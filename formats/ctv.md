# Prebid Connected TV

Prebid for CTV is a Prebid-based unified auction solution designed for CTV long-form video programmatic needs. 

Prebid aims to create a flexible solution that allows publishers to plug in 160+ video capable adapters for the demand sources either in publishers’ existing stack or as a stand-alone Prebid Server based programmatic demand source.

Prebid can be the best way to serve programmatic ads into long-form video content, both for remnant inventory as well as the primary demand source. It can be used for both client side and server side ad insertion, and can integrate with the publisher’s ad server of choice.  

Server side ad insertion dominates CTV ad serving ecosystem mainly due to the following reasons:

- A multitude of CTV device platforms and the complexities of implementing and managing client side ad insertions for all such platforms.
- Superior end user experience with smooth transition between content and the ads with matching video playback quality.
 
Prebid Server is the most commonly used methodology for accessing programmatic demand for the server side ad insertion use cases.

Prebid has published our CTV GET and VAST unwrapping requirements, which are now open for public feedback until Friday, October 10th. The document can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrEQk7gOZj0pUJHwVb7850awbQdiE8EfzciwlfvtSQQ).

We encourage the community to review the draft and share feedback directly as comments in the Google Doc. The Prebid team will actively monitor and respond to comments throughout the feedback period to ensure that all perspectives are considered.

Your input is critical in shaping these requirements, and our goal is to incorporate community insights before we begin development in Q4.
