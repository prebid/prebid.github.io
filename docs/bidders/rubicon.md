# Rubicon Bidder

Please contact [Rubicon Project](../../static/bidder-info/rubicon.yaml) to get set up with a login and cookie-sync URL to run your own Prebid Server.

You will be given instructions, including the available endpoints.

**Note:** Rubicon is disabled by default. Please reach out to your account team or globalsupport@rubiconproject.com for more information. Once you're set up with appropriate credentials, you can enable it in the config.
