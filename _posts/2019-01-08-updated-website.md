### Highlights:

- **Prebid.org is more than Prebid.js**: Prebid.js is likely to remain our most important product, but the new website has placed Prebid SDK and Prebid Server on equal footing with it -- all products are in their own areas now.

- **Updated Navigation**: The top and left navigation elements have been completely revised. The goal was to have *everything* in the left nav, and the most commonly used pages in the top nav.

- **Adaptive**: the site should look better than ever on small screens.

- **Cookie Permission**: you may have noticed already that we have a 'cookie banner' on the bottom asking for permission to set cookies. If you don't grant permission, some content like code examples and videos won't be available. There's also a new [privacy policy](/privacy.html).

- **New Content**:
  - [Prebid Server docs](/prebid-server/prebid-server-overview.html)
  - [Product Management Committees](/overview/prebid-management-committees.html)
  - [Community Code of Conduct](https://prebid.org/code-of-conduct/#community)
  - [Prebid Members and Partners](/partners/partners.html)
  - [Prebid Members providing Managed Services](https://prebid.org/product-suite/managed-services/)
  - [Format index page](/formats/formats.html)
