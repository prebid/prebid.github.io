### Prebid.js 2.0 is a minor major release

Compared to Prebid.js 1.0, the 2.0 release will be a non-event for most sites.

The Prebid.js team has adopted a policy of incrementing the major version number whenever there's a 'breaking change' -- a change in behavior we want everyone to be aware of. The idea is that everyone will wonder "what's with the new version", and come looking for blog entries like this. For 2.0, the change is:

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
The "[limited bid caching](/dev-docs/faq.html#does-prebidjs-cache-bids)" feature is now **off** by default.

Any publisher that was utilizing this limited form of bid caching may turn it back on. Do this by calling `setConfig()` with the [useBidCache](/dev-docs/publisher-api-reference.html#setConfig-Use-Bid-Cache) option.
