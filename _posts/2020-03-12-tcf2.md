The IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) version 2.0 for enhanced support of GDPR is scheduled to take effect April 1, 2020. This is a major update from TCF version 1.1.

The key changes are:
- More defined 'purposes'.
- More flexibility for the legal bases used by vendors.
- Different in-page JavaScript API.
