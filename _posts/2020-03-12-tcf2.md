The IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework version 2.0 for enhanced support of GDPR is scheduled to take effect Apr 1 2020. It's a major update from TCF 1.1.

The key changes are:
- More 'purposes' are defined.
- More flexibility for the legal bases used by vendors.
- Different in-page javascript API
