    returned from Prebid we can't be sure that the browser will
    reach the point where `invokeVideoPlayer` is defined before
    `bidsBackHandler` fires and tries to call it.

    To prevent an "`invokeVideoPlayer` not defined" error, we
    pre-define it before we make the call to Prebid, and redefine
    it later on with the code to create the player and play the
    ad.

    In this first version it simply stores the winning VAST to use
