# Prebid Website Maintenance Guide

v 1.0  
Janurary 7, 2019

***

## Core Technologies

The Prebid website is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which uses the following technology to create and style HTML pages. 

**Markdown**: The majority of the content is written in Markdown language. Jekyll transform this into raw HTML. 

Learn more about Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

**Bootstrap**: A CSS template for responsive site design. Bootstrap provides the base formatting for the site. 

Learn more about [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/_)

**Liquid**: A language created by Shopify to enable dynamic HTML creation. 

Learn more about [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/basics)

**Javascript**: A combination of Javascript libraries are utilized for the Prebid site to include [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [BootstrapJS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/) as well as custom code. 

**CSS**: The site builds on the base Bootstrap template with custom CSS stored in the style.css file. 

***

## Site Config

The _config.yml file (note underscore prefix) sets the base configuration for the site. Refer to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) documentation on which properties can be set in the _congig.yml file. 

***

## Directory Structure

Jekyll requires adherence to a certain directory structure to generate the site. Directories prefixed with an underscore contain files used to construct the html files of the site. 

### File Construction

For the Prebid.org site the following directories are used: 

**_data**  
Jekyll was originally designed specifically for creation of blogging websites and not for dynamic, data-driven sites. However, by including the _data directory we can mimic a database structure to create a more robust site. Files in this directory can be saved in either *json*, *yml* or *csv* format. For Prebid.org they have been saved in *yml*.

Learn more about YML [here](https://yaml.org/start.html)

There are three YML files in the Prebid _data directory

- [dropdown_v2](#Dropdown)
- [sidebar](#Sidebar)
- [messages](#Messages)

The contents of these files are used throughout the Prebid.org site for dynamically creating the navigation and displaying messages. See the [Data Model](#data-models) section for a review of how the data is structured and to see sample code.


**_layouts**  

The layout directory contains HTML files that, in conjunction with CSS and JS files, format the layout of pages throughout the site. 

**_includes**

The includes directory contains HTML files that can be included within files, such as a file for the header and footer. 

**_posts**  

The posts directory contains the files that make up the content of the blog section of the site. Unlike the layouts and includes directories, the posts files are written in Markdown. A blog.html file in the layout directory provides the formatting for these Markdown files. 

**_bidders** 

The bidders directory is not a standard part of Jekyll; itâ€™s a special use directory specifically for the Prebid.org site. The files in this directory are used to construct the table of partners on the partners/partners.html page. 

**_sites**

The sites directory is created by Jekyll. It contains the live site generated from the collected files and data listed above, combined with the CSS, JS and image assets and the Markdown files for individual pages. 

***

## Assets

The assets directory contains the CSS, Javascript, images and other assets used to create the site. 

The base CSS file used is Bootstrap (version 3.7.1) Custom CSS and modifications to Bootstrap classes are contained in the style.css file. 

The JS directory contains the Javascript files required for the Prebid.org site. It includes JQuery and Bootstrap javascript frameworks as well as other third party libraries and custom javascript written specifically for the Prebid site. For JQuery and Bootstrap both the expanded and minified versions of the javascript files are included but only the minified files are linked from the site header.

**Responsivenes**

| Width | Device | 
| --- | --- | 
| 1300 | Small browsers |
| 1024 | Large tablets e.g. iPadPro |

## Data Models

The data files are stored in the __data directory. 

### Dropdown

The dropdown_v2 YML file is used to construct the top nav when the site is viewed on desktops and tablets. 

The YML map is divided into collections of menu sections. Menu sections are commented when they begin, for example; 

```Markdown
#----------Product SubNav------------
```

Each menu item is represented in the YML map as a collection of key value pairs and begins with a dash (-) symbol. An indented collection indicates it is a child of the collection above it. Example: 

```Markdown
#-----------Overview---------------

- sectionId: 0
  sectionName: Overview
  link:
  isHeader: 1
  hasSubMenus: 1
  submenus:
  
  - subsectionId: 0
    sectionId: 0
    sectionName: Overview
    title: What is Prebid?
    link:  /overview/intro.html
    needsDivider: 0
    isHeader: 0
    isSubSectionStart: 1
```

The collection with the title property "What Is Prebid?" is a child of the collection directly above it with the sectionName "Overview"

**Top Nav Menu Collection Properties**  
*Note: A collection does not have to contain all properties. For Bools 1 = true, 0 = false*

| Key | Type | Example | Use |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| sectionId| Int | 3 | Indicates the menu section of an item. |
| sectionName |  string | Overview  | The display name of the section. |
| link |  string | /overview/intro.html  | The relative link that the menu item should open. |
| isHeader | bool | 1 | Indicates if this item is a section header. |
| hasSubMenus | bool | 1 | Indicates if this item has submenus. |

| subsectionId | int | 3 | Indicates the subsection of an item. | 
| needsDivider | bool | 0 | Indicates if the subsection item is the last item in the section and requires a divider. **Deprecated** |
| isSubsectionStart  | bool | 0 | Indicates if the item is the start of a subsection. **Deprecated** |
