# GAM Step by Step - Banner/Outstream/AMP Creatives

This page walks you through the steps required to create banner and outstream creatives to attach to your Prebid line items in Google Ad Manager (GAM).

{: .alert.alert-success :}
For complete instructions on setting up Prebid line items in Google Ad Manager, see [Google Ad Manager with Prebid Step by Step](/adops/step-by-step.html).

1. In GAM, select **Delivery** > **Creatives**.
2. Under the **Display creatives** tab, click **New Creative**.
3. Select your advertiser, then click **Third party**.
4. Enter a **Name** for your creative. For example, `Prebid – banner – 1x1 - 1`.
5. Enter a **Target ad unit size** of `1x1`. This allows the creative to serve on all inventory sizes.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
These instructions assume you're using the Prebid Universal Creative (PUC) after v1.15 that supports the separate `banner.js` file. See the [Prebid Universal Creative](/overview/prebid-universal-creative.html) documentation for alternate approaches.

{: .alert.alert-danger :}
**AMP**: If you choose to bypass the PUC for AMP, Prebid Server events will not work.

{:start="6"}
6. Select **Standard** as the **Code type**.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
**AMP**: If you are using AMP, you should still select **Standard** as the code type. The “AMP” option is for AMPHTML hosted by a 3rd party.

{:start="7"}
7. Enter one of the scripts shown below, depending on whether Prebid is configured to send all bids or only the top price bid.

**Send All Bids Configuration**

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
Be sure to replace BIDDERCODE with the appropriate bidder. For example, if the bidder code is `PBbidder`, the `adid` would be `%%PATTERN:hb_adid_PBbidder%%`.

```html
<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prebid-universal-creative@latest/dist/%%PATTERN:hb_format%%.js"></script>
<script>
  var ucTagData = {};
  ucTagData.adServerDomain = "";
  ucTagData.pubUrl = "%%PATTERN:url%%";
  ucTagData.adId = "%%PATTERN:hb_adid_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.cacheHost = "%%PATTERN:hb_cache_host_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.cachePath = "%%PATTERN:hb_cache_path_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.uuid = "%%PATTERN:hb_cache_id_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.mediaType = "%%PATTERN:hb_format_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.env = "%%PATTERN:hb_env%%";
  ucTagData.size = "%%PATTERN:hb_size_BIDDERCODE%%";
  ucTagData.hbPb = "%%PATTERN:hb_pb_BIDDERCODE%%";
  // mobileResize needed for mobile GAM only
  ucTagData.mobileResize = "hb_size:%%PATTERN:hb_size_BIDDERCODE%%";
  try {
    ucTag.renderAd(document, ucTagData);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
</script>
```

{: .alert.alert-info :}
Note: the `mobileResize` parameter is a workaround to a bug in the Google Mobile Ads SDK. The Prebid SDK uses the existence of the "hb_size" string that's provided in %%PATTERN:TARGETINGMAP%%, but this bidder-specific version of the creative doesn't utilize the TARGETINGMAP, so the value is added here. The important part is the value that contains `hb_size:`.

{: .alert.alert-danger :}
Warning: Be sure none of the attribute names are longer than 20 characters. See [Send All Bids Key Value Pairs](/adops/send-all-vs-top-price.html#key-value-pairs) for more information.

**Send Top Price Bid Configuration**

In top-price mode, you can make use of the GAM `TARGETINGMAP` feature instead of listing out each attribute.

```html
<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prebid-universal-creative@latest/dist/%%PATTERN:hb_format%%.js"></script>
<script>
  var ucTagData = {};
  ucTagData.adServerDomain = "";
  ucTagData.pubUrl = "%%PATTERN:url%%";
  ucTagData.targetingMap = %%PATTERN:TARGETINGMAP%%;
  ucTagData.hbPb = "%%PATTERN:hb_pb%%";

  try {
    ucTag.renderAd(document, ucTagData);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
</script>
```

{:start="8"}
8. Select whether to **Serve into a SafeFrame**. See [Creative Considerations](/adops/creative-considerations.html) for more on using SafeFrames.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
**AMP**: For AMP, you must select **Serve into a SafeFrame**.

Your creative settings will look something like this. In this example we're assuming a Send All Bids configuration, and we’ve replaced BIDDERCODE with the code for our bidder, PBbidder. (Notice that some of the key names have been truncated to adhere to the GAM 20-character key length limit.)

{: .alert.alert-info :}
Note: You can ignore the “Sorry, we don’t recognize this tag” warning. GAM doesn’t have built-in macros for Prebid and so doesn’t recognize them. The ad tag will still work correctly.

{:start="9"}
9. If you're using jsdelivr, set your **Associated ad technology provider**:

{% include /adops/adops-creative-declaration.html %}

{:start="10"}
10. Click **Save and preview**.
