# Prebid.org Community Code Of Conduct
{:.no_toc}

In order to encourage the development of quality products while maintaining a healthy open source community, Prebid.org members and contributors are expected to abide by technical and social conduct guidelines based on the core values of the organization.

## Prebid.org Core Values

The main objective of Prebid.org is to make great header bidding technology available for web publishers and mobile app developers. We believe great technology is:

+ Efficient - Products offered by Prebid.org should not burden a user device, the network, or a company server.
+ Secure - Prebid.org software should not open doors to security risks, including electronic attack, denial of service, fraud, or data leakage.
+ Transparent - Our products are built in the open with community review. Changes to Prebid software and modules must be open to inspection before and after release.
+ Fair - The Prebid.org platform doesn’t favor any one entity over another. No entity can be favored over another in technical ordering or status as a default value. No entity can gain information about another entity without approval.
+ Collaborative - Human interactions in Prebid.org public forums and events must be courteous.  

## Community Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Prebid team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors, contributors, and anyone seeking help and guidance. This isn’t an exhaustive list of guidelines. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Prebid.org. This includes GitHub, Slack, mailing lists, events, and any other avenues of communication created by the project team for the community. Violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing conduct@prebid.org. For more details please see the Reporting Guidelines below. 

+ Be friendly and patient.
+ Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
+ Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making those decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
+ Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Prebid.org community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Prebid.org community.
+ Be thoughtful in the words you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    + Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    + Discriminatory jokes and language.
    + Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    + Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    + Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    + Unwelcome sexual attention.
    + Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    + Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
+ Be understanding. When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re all different. The strength of an open source project comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Prebid Conduct Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to Prebid.org by emailing conduct@prebid.org. All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

We encourage you to report an incident even if you are unsure whether it is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct and the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

+ Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
+ Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
+ When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
+ Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
+ Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
+ Whether you believe this incident is ongoing.
+ Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from Prebid.org acknowledging receipt. We promise to acknowledge receipt within one business day.

The working group will meet to review the incident and determine:

+ What happened.
+ Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
+ Who the bad actor was.
+ Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

If the incident is determined to be ongoing or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.
Once the working group has a complete account of the events we will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

+ Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
+ A technical fix, if appropriate.
+ A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
+ A public reprimand.
+ An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or Slack).
+ A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Prebid spaces (mailing lists, Slack, etc.)
+ A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter with an update.

Finally, the working group will make a report on the situation to the Prebid.org Board. The Board may choose to release a public report of the incident.

### Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of the committee’s decision. To make such a request, contact the Prebid.org Board at board@prebid.org with your request and motivation and the board will review the case.
