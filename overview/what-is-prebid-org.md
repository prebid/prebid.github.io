# About Prebid.org

Header bidding has seen incredible adoption across the industry, and Prebid.js has been an integral part of that. While AppNexus created Prebid.js, it's too important to be owned by any one company. Thus, Prebid.org was created.

Formed in September of 2017, Prebid.org is an independent organization designed to ensure and promote fair, transparent, and efficient header bidding across the industry. Funded by dues-paying members, it manages the open source projects Prebid.js, Prebid Mobile, Prebid Server, Prebid Video, Prebid Native, and others.

Prebid.org is open to all companies who are part of the programmatic ecosystem, from ad tech vendors to publishers and others. We believe strongly that by working together, we can do some great things in the industry.

To obtain more information about becoming a member of Prebid.org, email membership@prebid.org.
