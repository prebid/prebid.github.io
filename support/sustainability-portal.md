## Overview

The digital advertising industry's environmental impact continues to grow alongside its expanding role in the global economy. To address this challenge, Prebid.org established a Supply Chain & Sustainability Taskforce.

As the industry works toward defining sustainability standards, this taskforce serves as a central resource for documentation and best practices, helping organizations align their operations with broader sustainability goals. This initiative reflects Prebid's commitment to promoting environmental responsibility while maintaining the transparency and efficiency of the digital advertising supply chain.

This portal organizes existing Prebid documentation through the lens of sustainability, providing practical guidance for both Publishers and Tech Partners. The content is structured into two main sections, each further categorized by Prebid software components (such as Prebid.js and Prebid Server) and conceptual areas (including Analytics and Bidders). This organization allows stakeholders to easily access relevant information for their specific needs while working toward more sustainable advertising practices.

Many of the best practices boil down to a simple philosophy:

Good housekeeping is good for sustainability.

A fair amount of value can be obtained from:

- Retaining only the bidders, modules, and identity providers that are providing value, removing those that do not.
- Upgrading Prebid more often to receive efficiency-related updates.
