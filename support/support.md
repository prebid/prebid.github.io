# Need Help?

Prebid.js is worked on full-time by AppNexus's tagging engineering team, as well as by many publishers using and contributing to the project. The bidder adaptors are being maintained by the bidders (Sovrn, AOL, OpenX, Yieldbot). The Github open source community is also very active in answering questions.
