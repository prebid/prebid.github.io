{:.no_toc}

There are several ways to ask for help or get involved with Prebid.  See below for more information.

## Overview

For technical and feature requests or questions, it's best to use GitHub. Prebid is worked on by engineering teams from Xandr, Magnite, Pubmatic, IndexExchange, and other companies. There are also many publishers using and contributing to the project.

For questions about how an adapter works, it's best to reach out to the company directly, or raise an issue on GitHub. Each demand adapter should be maintained by the SSPs or exchange behind that adapter.

There are serveral Prebid.org members that will install and maintain Prebid on a publisher's behalf. See the list of [Managed Prebid Solutions](https://prebid.org/product-suite/managed-services/).
