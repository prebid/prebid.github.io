Prebid.org is not a vendor, tracker, or processor of personal information on independent sites or apps running prebid software. There is no reason to seek consent for Prebid's vendor id unless a publisher is using long-deprecated functionality. Values such as _pbjs_userid_consent_data are written by the publisher themselves and should be declared as such. Publishers seeking to understand all values should consider setting strictStorageEnforcement or reference relevant prebid documentation discussing each value."
