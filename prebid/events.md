{:.no_toc}

{% capture alert %}
With due regard to the safe and healthy environment for attendees in London, Prebid.org has cancelled the Prebid.org Meetup and Leadership Summit, scheduled for April 30th in London.  The global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for Prebid.org to hold the event.
<br/><br/>
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and Prebid.org will be working to reschedule the event for later in the year. Registered attendees will be notified of the new date as soon as possible.  Our sympathies at this time are with those affected by the coronavirus.

## What happens at an event?

A Prebid Meetup and Leadership Summit is an educational event including
overviews, deep dives and conversations about Prebid, its evolution, roadmap
and vision. Itâ€™s a chance to get key insights on the latest Prebid
solutions and how they work for different kinds of publishers. Here are
a few things you can expect from these events:

- Insights from member organizations and premium publishers into current best practices and future plans for Prebid.
- Panel discussions on the expansion of header bidding into emerging formats, such as video and native.
- Networking opportunities for publishers and [Prebid members](/partners/partners.html).
- And more!

We look forward to seeing you at an event.


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Are there any online recordings of past events?

Not at this point.

## Will events be livestreamed or recorded in the future?

We are considering this option, but the in-person meetings have been quite
candid, and we don't want to change the comfort level of our panel members and
audience members in speaking their minds.
