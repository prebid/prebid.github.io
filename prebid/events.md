## What happens at an event?

A Prebid Meetup and Leadership Summit is an educational event including
overviews, deep dives and conversations about Prebid, its evolution, roadmap
and vision. Itâ€™s a chance to get key insights on the latest Prebid
solutions and how they work for different kinds of publishers. Here are
a few things you can expect from this event:

- Insights from member organizations and premium publishers into current best practices and future plans for Prebid.
- Panel discussions on the expansion of header bidding into emerging formats, such as video and native.
- Networking opportunities for publishers and Prebid members.
- And more!

We look forward to seeing you at an event.


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Are there any online recordings of past events?

Not at this point.

## Will events be livestreamed or recorded in the future?

We are considering this option, but the in-person meetings have been quite
candid, and we don't want to change the comfort level of our panel members and
audience members in speaking their minds.
