## Important Prebid.js Releases

Not every Prebid.js release contains noteworthy core features, and
the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases) can be hard to search for when an important change or bugfix was made.

The table below is a summary of feature changes and important bug fixes in core of Prebid.js. Almost [all releases](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases) have new bid adapters or updates to existing adapters -- what's listed here is limited to core functionality. Releases with only minor core changes may not be shown here, and releases with multiple important changes may be shown more than once.
