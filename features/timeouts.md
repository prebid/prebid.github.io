# Prebid Timeouts

Header bidding needs some time to collect bids. Publishers update their
pages to delay the ad server call for just long enough to get bids, but
not so long as to reduce overall revenue. This delay is controlled by
a number of timeouts and adjustments.

The following diagram summarizes the timeouts in Prebid.js and Prebid Server.

1. **Failsafe Timeout** - This is a timeout entirely outside of Prebid.js. It's a
JavaScript setTimeout() that publishers should consider establishing
after the Prebid.js code is loaded. It's a safety net that invokes the ad
server callback in case something goes wrong. In all regular scenarios,
Prebid.js will have already invoked the callback before this timeout is reached. This value should be much larger than the auction timeout.
2. **Auction Timeout** - This value defines the amount of time the page has to coordinate the
header bidding activities. Determining this value is a delicate balance: too short, and header bidding won't have enough time to take place; too long, and revenue
may go down due to delaying the ad server call to the point where users have left
the page. Publishers must determine the value that works for them, considering
a balance of factors: average user time on page, direct sellthrough, value of different ad channels, and average user network delay.
3. **Timout Buffer** - The JavaScript timer environment is not perfectly accurate
because competing JavaScript on the page can delay the header bidding auction
or the recognition that auction results have returned. By default, Prebid.js adds a 400ms buffer to the Auction Timeout to account for the noisy environment. Publishers can
change this default value with the [`timeoutBuffer`](/dev-docs/publisher-api-reference.html#setConfig-timeoutBuffer) configuration.
4. **Prebid Server s2sConfig Timeout** - In order to make sure that Prebid Server
bids can get back to the client in time for the ad server call, publishers
should consider setting [s2sConfig.timeout](/dev-docs/publisher-api-reference.html#setConfig-Server-to-Server) to a value lower than the Auction Timeout. How much lower depends on average user network delay, but should probably be within the range of 50%-75% of the Auction Timeout. This value is sent in the Prebid Server OpenRTB as `tmax`.
5. **Timeout Adjustment** - In order to minimize the chance of missing the client-side
ad server call, Prebid Server shaves off a safety buffer and responds to the client a little before the `tmax` value time is up. The Prebid Server host company sets two
configurable values (`auction.timeout-adjustment-ms` and `auction.cache.expected-request-time-ms`), which can be expected to shave 30-100ms off of `tmax`. For example, if tmax=1000 and the Prebid Server host company has 40ms of safety margin configured,
bidders will actually timeout at 960ms.

### Prebid SDK Timeouts

The SDK `setTimeoutMillis()` function is a "failsafe" timeout on the app side.

The Prebid Server timeout value comes from `tmax` in the top level stored request.

There is no "Timeout Buffer" in the SDK scenario, but Prebid Server will shave
off the Timeout Adjustment.

### AMP Timeouts

AMP pages may pass a timeout attribute on the query string. This value will override the default that's set in the stored request.

There is no "Timeout Buffer" in the AMP scenario, but Prebid Server will shave
off the Timeout Adjustment.
