# Prebid Server Has Two Code Bases

The original version of Prebid Server was the Go-Lang version. Rubicon Project ported it to Java because they had more engineers who knew Java than Go.

- [Prebid Server - Go](/prebid-server/versions/pbs-versions-go.html)
- [Prebid Server - Java](/prebid-server/versions/pbs-versions-java.html)

Both versions are live in production, and they are kept identical in external APIs and reasonably close in functionality.

For demand partners, we recommend building new bid adapters in Go - the team will port it to Java for you within a couple of months.

For those looking to host a Prebid Server, here's some guidance:

- If you plan to use long-form video, we recommend the Go version of the server.
- Look over the [features](/prebid-server/features/index.html) and see if there are any important to you.
- Otherwise, just choose the language your engineering team is most comfortable with inspecting and enhancing.
