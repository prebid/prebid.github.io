## Overview

[Confiant](https://www.confiant.com/) is an industry leader in the field of ad tech security and quality.
This module provides a low latency pre-auction scanning for such issues.
Any suggestions or questions can be directed to [support@confiant.com](mailto:support@confiant.com) e-mail.

## Configuration

### Execution Plan

This module supports running at the stage:

- all-processed-bid-responses: this is where all bids are back and PBS-core bid validations are done.

### Account-Level Config

Here's a general template for the account config used in PBS-Java:

```yaml
hooks:
    confiant-ad-quality:
        enabled: true
    host-execution-plan: >
        {
          "endpoints": {
            "/openrtb2/auction": {
              "stages": {
                "all-processed-bid-responses": {
                  "groups": [
                    {
                      "timeout": 200,
                      "hook-sequence": [
                        {
                          "module-code": "confiant-ad-quality",
                          "hook-impl-code": "confiant-ad-quality-bid-responses-scan-hook"
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
```
