# 51Degrees Device Detection Module
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
  {:toc }

## Overview

The 51Degrees module enriches an incoming OpenRTB request with [51Degrees Device Data](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__overview.html).

The module sets the following fields of the device object: `make`, `model`, `os`, `osv`, `h`, `w`, `ppi`, `pxratio` - interested bidder adapters may use these fields as needed.  In addition the module sets `device.ext.fiftyonedegrees_deviceId` to a permanent device ID which can be rapidly looked up in on premise data exposing over 250 properties including the device age, chip set, codec support, and price, operating system and app/browser versions, age, and embedded features.

## Operation Details

### Evidence

The module uses `device.ua` (User Agent) and `device.sua` (Structured User Agent) provided in the oRTB request payload as input (or 'evidence' in 51Degrees terminology).  There is a fallback to the corresponding HTTP request headers if any of these are not present in the oRTB payload - in particular: `User-Agent` and `Sec-CH-UA-*` (aka User-Agent Client Hints).  To make sure Prebid.js sends Structured User Agent in the oRTB payload - we strongly advice publishers to enable [First Party Data Enrichment module](dev-docs/modules/enrichmentFpdModule.html) for their wrappers and specify 

```js
pbjs.setConfig({
    firstPartyData: {
        uaHints: [
          'architecture',
          'model',
          'platform',
          'platformVersion',
          'fullVersionList',
        ]
    }
})
```

### Data File Updates

The module operates **fully autonomously and does not make any requests to any cloud services in real time to do device detection**. This is an [on-premise data](https://51degrees.com/developers/deployment-options/on-premise-data) deployment in 51Degrees terminology. The module operates using a local data file that is loaded into memory fully or partially during operation. The data file is occasionally updated to accomodate new devices, so it is recommended to enable automatic data updates in the module configuration. Alternatively `watch_file_system` option can be used and the file may be downloaded and replaced on disk manually. See the configuration options below. 

## Setup

The 51Degrees module operates using a data file. You can get started with a free Lite data file that can be downloaded here: [51Degrees-LiteV4.1.hash](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-data/blob/main/51Degrees-LiteV4.1.hash).  The Lite file is capable of detecting limited device information, so if you need in-depth device data, please contact 51Degrees to obtain a license: [https://51degrees.com/contact-us](https://51degrees.com/contact-us?ContactReason=Free%20Trial).

Put the data file in a file system location writable by the system account that is running the Prebid Server module and specify that directory location in the configuration parameters. The location needs to be writable if you would like to enable [automatic data file updates](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_features__automatic_datafile_updates.html).

### Execution Plan

This module supports running at two stages:

* entrypoint: this is where incoming requests are parsed and device detection evidences are extracted.
* raw-auction-request: this is where outgoing auction requests to each bidder are enriched with the device detection data

We recommend defining the execution plan right in the account config
so the module is only invoked for specific accounts. See below for an example.

### Global Config

There is no host-company level config for this module.

### Account-Level Config

To start using current module in PBS-Java you have to enable module and add `fiftyone-devicedetection-entrypoint-hook` and `fiftyone-devicedetection-raw-auction-request-hook` into hooks execution plan inside your yaml file:
Here's a general template for the account config used in PBS-Java:

```yaml
hooks:
  fiftyone-devicedetection:
    enabled: true
  host_execution_plan: >
    {
      "endpoints": {
        "/openrtb2/auction": {
          "stages": {
            "entrypoint": {
              "groups": [
                {
                  "timeout": 100,
                  "hook-sequence": [
                    {
                      "module-code": "fiftyone-devicedetection",
                      "hook-impl-code": "fiftyone-devicedetection-entrypoint-hook"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            },
            "raw-auction-request": {
              "groups": [
                {
                  "timeout": 100,
                  "hook-sequence": [
                    {
                      "module-code": "fiftyone-devicedetection",
                      "hook-impl-code": "fiftyone-devicedetection-raw-auction-request-hook"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

Minimal sample (only required):

```yaml
  modules:

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## List of module configuration options (same for PBS-Java and PBS-Go)

* `account-filter`
  * `allow-list` - _(list of strings)_ -  A list of account IDs that are allowed to use this module. If empty, everyone is allowed. Full-string match is performed (whitespaces and capitalization matter). Defaults to empty.
  * `data-file`
    * `path` - _(string, **REQUIRED**)_ -  The full path to the device detection data file. Sample file can be downloaded from [data repo on GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-data/blob/main/51Degrees-LiteV4.1.hash).
    * `make-temp-copy` - _(boolean)_ - If true, the engine will create a temporary copy of the data file rather than using the data file directly. Defaults to false.
    * `update`
      * `auto` - _(boolean)_ - Enable/Disable auto update. Defaults to enabled. If enabled, the auto update system will automatically download and apply new data files for device detection.
      * `on-startup` - _(boolean)_ - Enable/Disable update on startup. Defaults to enabled. If enabled, the auto update system will be used to check for an update before the device detection engine is created. If an update is available, it will be downloaded and applied before the pipeline is built and returned for use so this may take some time.
      * `url` - _(string)_ - Configure the engine to use the specified URL when looking for an updated data file. Default is the 51Degrees update URL.
      * `license-key` - _(string)_ - Set the license key used when checking for new device detection data files. Defaults to null.
      * `watch-file-system` - _(boolean)_ - The data update service has the ability to watch a file on disk and refresh the engine as soon as that file is updated. This setting enables/disables that feature. Defaults to true.
      * `polling-interval` - _(int, seconds)_ - Set the time between checks for a new data file made by the DataUpdateService in seconds. Default = 30 minutes.
  * `performance` - please note: this is the speed of device detection, do not confuse with revenue performance of the module
    * `profile` - _(string)_ - Set the performance profile for the device detection engine. Must be one of: `LowMemory`, `MaxPerformance`, `HighPerformance`, `Balanced`, `BalancedTemp`, `InMemory`. Defaults to `Balanced`.
    * `concurrency` - _(int)_ - Set the expected number of concurrent operations using the engine. This sets the concurrency of the internal caches to avoid excessive locking. Default: 10.
    * `difference` - _(int)_ - Set the maximum difference to allow when processing HTTP headers. The meaning of difference depends on the Device Detection API being used. The difference is the difference in hash value between the hash that was found, and the hash that is being searched for. By default this is 0. For more information see [51Degrees documentation](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__hash.html).
    * `allow-unmatched` - _(boolean)_ - If set to false, a non-matching User-Agent will result in properties without set values.
      If set to true, a non-matching User-Agent will cause the 'default profiles' to be returned. This means that properties will always have values (i.e. no need to check .hasValue) but some may be inaccurate. By default, this is false.
    * `drift` - _(int)_ - Set the maximum drift to allow when matching hashes. If the drift is exceeded, the result is considered invalid and values will not be returned. By default this is 0. For more information see [51Degrees documentation](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__hash.html).
