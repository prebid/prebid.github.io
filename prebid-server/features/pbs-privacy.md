## Mobile 'Limit Ad Tracking' flag

If PBS receives 'device.lmt' flag in the OpenRTB request, it does the following anonymization:

- Mask take off the last byte of the IPv4 address and anonymize IPv6 addresses
- Removes user.id and user.buyeruid
- Removes the request.device.ifa attribute
- Rounds the request.device.geo. {lat,lon} to two decimal places

## GDPR

Prebid Server host companies and publishers have the ability to control the enforcement
activities that take place.

The enforcement strategy changed significantly between TCF 1.1 and TCF 2.0. [TCF2](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md) is a 
more nuanced and stricter policy.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
If a Prebid Server host company wants to support GDPR, they must currently [register for the IAB Global Vendor List](https://register.consensu.org/). 
The user must provide legal basis for the host company to read/write cookies or `/cookie_sync` will return an empty response with no syncs and `/setuid` will fail.

### TCF 1.1

If Prebid Server determines that the user is in GDPR scope and doesn't consent
to *all* of the vendor's 'purposes' as declared in the Global Vendor List, it 'anonymizes'
the request to the adapters:

- Mask take off the last byte of the IPv4 address and anonymize IPv6 addresses
- Removes user.id and user.buyeruid
- Removes the request.device.ifa attribute
- Rounds the request.device.geo. {lat,lon} to two decimal places

Full details are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0zAYc_EfqyilKD8N2qQ47uz0hdahY-t8vfb-vxZL5w/edit).

### TCF 2.0

If Prebid server determines the user is in GDPR scope, then consent is independently tested
for each 'Purpose' with different consequences for each:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Activity | Legal Basis Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Responding to /cookie-sync requests | Purpose 1 (Device Access) |
| Setting a cookie on /setuid requests | Purpose 1 (Device Access) |
| Conducting auctions | Purpose 2 (Basic Ads) |
| Passing User IDs into an auction | Any Purpose 2-10. User IDs are important for more than personalizing ads - they can be used in frequency capping, building profiles, counting unique users, etc. So Prebid Server should pass User IDs through the auction if any of Purposes 2-10 pass the legal basis test. |
| Invoke an analytics adapter | Purpose 7 |
| Pass the userâ€™s precise geographic information into auctions | Special Feature 1 |

More details are available in the [Prebid Support for TCF2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBRaodKifv1pYsWY3ia-9K96VHUjd8kKvxZlOsozm8E/edit#) reference and in the [Prebid Server GDPR Reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0zAYc_EfqyilKD8N2qQ47uz0hdahY-t8vfb-vxZL5w/edit#).

### GDPR Configuration

There are a number of configuration settings that PBS Host Companies need
to consider:

- Host company GVL ID. Currently PBS requires the host company to have a GVL-ID or the setting of the `uids` cookie in GDPR scope will fail.
- The default expiration time of the uids cookie set in the host company domain should be defined to match what's in the TCF 2.1 `maxCookieAgeSeconds` GVL field.
- GDPR enforcement flags for each Purpose and Vendor

The specific details vary slightly between PBS-Go and PBS-Java, so check the
version-specific documentation for more information.

## COPPA

The [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule) is a law in the US which imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
If `regs.coppa` is set to '1' on the OpenRTB request, the following anonymization actions take place before going to the adapters:

- Removes all ID fields: device.ifa, device.macsha1, device.macmd5, device.dpidsha1, device.dpidmd5, device.didsha1, device.didmd5
- Truncate ip field - remove lowest 8 bits.
- Truncate ipv6 field - remove lowest 32 bits.
- Remove geo.lat, geo.lon. geo.metro, geo.city, and geo.zip
- Remove user.id, user.buyeruid, user.yob, and user.gender

## CCPA / US-Privacy

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) is a law in the US. which covers consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information that is collected by businesses.
The IAB has generalized
this state-specific rule into a [US Privacy](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/) compliance framework.
If `regs.ext.us_privacy` is parsed to find that the user has opted-out of a "sale",
the following anonymization steps are taken:

- Mask the last byte of the IPv4 address and anonymize IPv6 addresses
- Removes user.id and user.buyeruid
- Removes the request.device.ifa attribute
- Rounds the request.device.geo. {lat,lon} to two decimal places

## DNT

Prebid Server does **not** recognize the Do-Not-Track header. The committee determined that it's obsolete in general and not supported on Safari specifically. We prefer not to implement, test, and document unsupported privacy flags. Prebid Server is not going to make a dent in the overall problems with DNT.

We may reconsider this position if community members provide evidence that the flag is meaningful to their customers or lawyers.

## Anonymizing IPv6 Addresses

IPv6 addresses may be anonymized differently for Prebid Server host companies depending on how they've configured the server:

- There's a setting to mask the network portion of the IPv6 address when anonymization is called for. It defaults to 56 bits, meaning the rightmost 8 bits of the network is removed in these scenarios.
- There's another setting to remove a number of bits in the MAC address portion of the IPv6 address regardless of whether it's a situation that calls for explicit privacy or not. This setting defaults to removing all 64 bits of the MAC address.
