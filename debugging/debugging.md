# Chrome Extension for Debugging Prebid.js

Prebid.Org supports the Chrome extension [Headerbid Expert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headerbid-expert/cgfkddgbnfplidghapbbnngaogeldmop). Web publishers can use this tool to understand how their Prebid.js header bidding partners are doing:

1. What's the latency from each header bidding partner?
1. Do they load asynchronously or are they blocking my pages?
1. Are they all loaded together in parallel?

Use the tool to determine whether a page might be under-monetized or could
benefit from implementation improvements.
