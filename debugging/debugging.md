# Chrome Extension for Debugging Prebid.js

Prebid.Org supports the Chrome extension [Headerbid Expert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headerbid-expert/cgfkddgbnfplidghapbbnngaogeldmop). Web publishers can use this tool to understand how their Prebid.js header bidding partners are doing. For example:

- What's the latency from each header bidding partner?
- Do they load asynchronously or are they blocking my pages?
- Are they all loaded together in parallel?

Use the tool to determine whether a page might be under-monetized or could
benefit from implementation improvements.
