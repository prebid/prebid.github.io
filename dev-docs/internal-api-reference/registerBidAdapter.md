This function provides a way to register a bid adapter for use by Prebid.js. The intended use case is in registering a non-open-source adapter that a publisher may add into their Prebid.js package. After calling this function, Prebid.js will recognize the biddercode in adunits and everywhere a bidder code can be used.
