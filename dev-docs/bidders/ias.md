### Note:

This module is an integration with prebid.js with an IAS product, pet.js. It is not a bidder per se but works in a similar way: retrieve data that publishers might be interested in setting keyword targeting, like predicted viewability and brand safety words. Please reach out to your account manager or check out [our publisher solutions](https://integralads.com/solutions/publishers/) for more
information.
