### Note:
The Consumable adaptor requires setup and approval from your Consumable account manager, even for existing Consumable publishers. Please reach out to your account manager to enable Prebid.js for your account.

### Disclosure:
The Consumable bid adapter may cycle the ad initially shown with a new one at various intervals. This means the advertiser meta-data accompanying the bid response may be incomplete at the time of response.
