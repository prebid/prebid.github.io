### Disclosure

The BeOp bidder adapter requires an `accountId` or `networkId`, which you can retrieve from your BeOp platform dashboard (as a publisher, reseller, or media group). To activate BeOp demand on your account, please contact your account manager or reach out to <publishers@beop.io>.

### Bid Params

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Name | Scope | Description | Example | Type |
|---------------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `accountId` or `networkId` | required | Your BeOp account ID (24-character hex string) | `'5a8af500c9e77c00017e4cad'` | `string` |
| `networkPartnerId` | optional | Your internal network partner ID (used for advanced partner tracking) | `'MY-WEBSITE-123'` | `string` |
| `currency` | optional | Preferred bidding currency (defaults to `'EUR'`) | `'EUR'` or `'USD'` | `string` |
| `keywords` | optional | Contextual keywords string or array to help target your campaign | `'cars, racing'` or `['cars', 'racing']` | `string/array` |

### User Syncs

BeOp supports iframe and pixel-based user syncs using the `getUserSyncs` method.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Type | Supported | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| iframe | yes | A sync iframe may be returned by the bidder response via `syncFrame`. |
| pixel | yes | Additional sync pixels can be returned via `syncPixels` array in the bid response body. |

> Syncs are GDPR-aware and only triggered when appropriate consent is provided.

### GDPR Compliance

- Vendor ID: `666`
- BeOp supports TCFv2 and relies on the `gdprApplies` and `consentString` fields in the bid request.
- If no valid consent is found, external user syncs will be disabled.

### Cookie Usage

BeOp sets a first-party cookie `beopid` for frequency capping and user session purposes. This ID is anonymized and used to improve campaign performance, capping logic, and personalization within publisher domains.

### First-Party Data Support

BeOp fully supports First-Party Data (FPD) and leverages it to enhance both targeting and audience intelligence for publishers.

- Audience Enrichment: BeOp campaigns often include interactive formats (polls, quizzes, votes) that collect high-quality declarative data. This data can be matched against publisher segments to enrich their DMPs (Data Management Platforms).
- Publisher-Centric Segments: Collected FPD (such as quiz responses, poll preferences, etc.) can be made available to the publisher under consent, allowing creation of custom audience segments usable across future campaigns.
- Ortb2 Integration: BeOp reads ortb2.user.ext.data, ortb2.user.ext.bpsegs, and similar fields in the bid request to enhance match rates and ensure contextually relevant responses.
- Respect for Privacy: All data is handled in accordance with GDPR, with processing based on user consent and transparent storage mechanisms.

Thanks to BeOpâ€™s unique interactive formats, publishers benefit not only from monetization, but also from deeper understanding and activation of their audiences through real-time feedback.
