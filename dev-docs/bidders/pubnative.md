### Registration

Before adding PubNative as a new bidder, there are 3 prerequisites:
- As a Publisher, you need to have Prebid Mobile SDK integrated.
- You need a configured Prebid Server (either self-hosted or hosted by 3rd party).
- You need to be integrated with Ad Server SDK (e.g. Mopub) or internal product which communicates with Prebid Mobile SDK.

Please see [documentation](https://developers.pubnative.net/docs/prebid-adding-pubnative-as-a-bidder) for more info.
