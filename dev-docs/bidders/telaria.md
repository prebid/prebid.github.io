### Delivery

+ `1` : In-Stream: Played before, during or after the streaming video content that the consumer has requested (e.g., Pre-roll, Mid-roll, Post-roll).
+ `2` : In-Banner: Exists within a web banner that leverages the banner space to deliver a video experience as opposed to another static or rich media format. The format relies on the existence of display ad inventory on the page for its delivery.
+ `3` : In-Article: Loads and plays dynamically between paragraphs of editorial content; existing as a standalone branded message.
+ `4` : In-Feed: Found in content, social, or product feeds.
+ `5` : Interstitial/Slider/Floating: Covers the entire or a portion of screen area, but is always on screen while displayed (i.e. cannot be scrolled out of view). Note that a full-screen interstitial (e.g., in mobile) can be distinguished from a floating/slider unit by the imp.instl field.

### Placement

+ `1` : Streaming
+ `2` : Progressive
+ `3` : Download
