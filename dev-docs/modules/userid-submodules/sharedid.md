useridmodule: sharedIdSystem
---


This module stores an unique user id in the first party domain and makes it accessible to all adapters. Similar to IDFA and AAID, this is a simple UUID that can be utilized to improve user matching, especially for iOS and MacOS browsers, and is compatible with ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention). Itâ€™s lightweight and self contained. Adapters that support SharedId will be able to pick up the user ID and return it for additional server-side cross device tracking.

There is no special registration or configuration for SharedID. Each publisher's privacy policy should take
SharedID into account.  Prebid  recommends implementing a method where users can easily opt-out of targeted advertising. Please refer to the User Opt-Out section located at the bottom of this page. For more information check out Prebid's dedicated [identity page](/identity/sharedid.html)

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=sharedIdSystem

## SharedID ID Configuration

In addition to the parameters documented above in the Basic Configuration section the following SharedID specific configuration is available:

## SharedID Examples

1. Publisher supports SharedID and first party domain cookie storage

    ```javascript
    pbjs.setConfig({
        userSync: {
            userIds: [{
                name: "sharedId",
                storage: {
                    type: "cookie",
                    name: "_sharedid",         // create a cookie with this name
                    expires: 365             // expires in 1 years
                }
            }]
        }
    });
    ```

2. Publisher supports both UnifiedID and SharedID and first party domain cookie storage

    ```javascript
    pbjs.setConfig({
        userSync: {
            userIds: [{
                name: "unifiedId",
                params: {
                    partner: "myTtdPid"
                },
                storage: {
                    type: "cookie",
                    name: "pbjs-unifiedid",       // create a cookie with this name
                    expires: 60
                }
            },{
                name: "sharedId",
                params: {
                    pixelUrl: "/wp-json/pubcid/v1/extend/"
                },
                storage: {
                    type: "cookie",
                    name: "_sharedid",      // create a cookie with this name
                    expires: 180
                }
            }],
            syncDelay: 5000       // 5 seconds after the first bidRequest()
        }
    });
    ```

3. Publisher supports SharedID and first party domain cookie storage initiated by a first party server

    ```javascript
    pbjs.setConfig({
        userSync: {
            userIds: [{
                name: "sharedId",
                params: {
                    pixelUrl: "/wp-json/pubcid/v1/extend/" //pixelUrl should be specified when the server plugin is used
                },
                storage: {
                    type: "cookie",
                    name: "_sharedid",        // create a cookie with this name
                    expires: 365              // expires in 1 year
                }
            }]
        }
    });
    ```
