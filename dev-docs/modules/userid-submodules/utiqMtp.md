A website visitorâ€™s Utiq ID is generated based on network identifiers provided by network operators and requires explicit user consent.

Utiq provides different tokens type, known as 'adtechpass' and 'martechpass'. UtiqMtpId module helps publishers support and pass the 'martechpass' token to their SSP partners of choice.
