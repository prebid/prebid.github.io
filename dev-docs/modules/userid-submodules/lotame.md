[Lotame Panorama ID™](https://www.lotame.com/panorama-id/) is a pseudonymous ID that represents devices for the purposes of audience enrichment and campaign activation. It is powered by the Lotame Panorama Graph, which is built on hashed emails and browser and device data and combined with machine learning and predictive models to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or are in the same household.

Lotame’s Panorama ID™ module sends the IP address, user agent, and timestamp from the request to Lotame in order to successfully generate a Panorama IDTM. For more information on how the Panorama IDTM works, please visit [https://www.lotame.com/panorama-identity/](https://www.lotame.com/panorama-identity/).

Through registering above, your organization will execute Lotame’s Panorama ID Enrollment Terms for Prebid.org. Lotame’s [Services Privacy Notice](https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/) describes the processing of personal data by Lotame.

If you have any questions about Panorama ID, please reach out by emailing [prebid@lotame.com](mailto:prebid@lotame.com).

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

```bash
gulp build --modules=lotamePanoramaIdSystem
```
