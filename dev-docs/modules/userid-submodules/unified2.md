Unified ID 2 is an email based id solution that is owned and operated by the prebid community.  Unified ID 2, relies on user consent before an id can be added to the bid stream.  Consent can be gathered by SSO providers who have integrated against the UID 2 framework, or Publishers own login & consent mechaninism.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=uid2IdSystem

## Unified ID Registration

You can set up Unified ID 2 in one of these ways:

- Include the module to your pb.js wrapper, no registration is required
- Utilize a [managed services](https://prebid.org/product-suite/managed-services/) company who can do this for you.

Each publisherâ€™s privacy policy should take UnifiedId 2 into account
