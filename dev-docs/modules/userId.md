# User ID Module
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview

The User ID module supports multiple ways of establishing pseudonymous IDs for users, which is an important way of increasing the value of header bidding. Instead of having several exchanges sync IDs with dozens of demand sources, a publisher can choose to integrate with any of a number of ID schemes.

## How It Works

1. The publisher determines which user ID modules to add to their Prebid.js package and consults with their legal counsel to determine the appropriate user disclosures.
1. The publisher builds Prebid.js by specifying one or more ID sub-modules they would like to include. e.g. "gulp build --modules=____IdSystem". You also need to add the `userId` module to your Prebid.js distribution.
1. The page defines User ID configuration in `pbjs.setConfig()`
1. When `setConfig()` is called, and if the user has consented to storing IDs locally, the module is invoked to call the URL if needed
   1. If the relevant local storage is present, the module doesn't call the URL and instead parses the scheme-dependent format, injecting the resulting ID into bidRequest.userId.
1. An object containing one or more IDs (bidRequest.userId) is made available to Prebid.js adapters and Prebid Server S2S adapters.
1. In addition to bidRequest.userId, bidRequest.userIdAsEids is made available to Prebid.js adapters and Prebid Server S2S adapters. bidRequest.userIdAsEids has userIds in ORTB EIDS format.

Note that User IDs aren't needed in the mobile app world because device ID is available in those ad serving scenarios.

Also note that not all bidder adapters support all forms of user ID. See the tables below for a list of which bidders support which ID schemes.

As of Prebid 4.0, this module will attempt storage in the main domain of the publisher's website instead of a subdomain, unless this behavior is overriden by a submodule.

## User ID, GDPR, Permissions, and Opt-Out

When paired with the [Consent Management](/dev-docs/modules/consentManagement.html) module, privacy rules are enforced:

* The module checks the GDPR consent string
* If no consent string is available OR if the user has not consented to Purpose 1 (local storage):
  * Calls to an external user ID vendor are not made.
  * Nothing is stored to cookies or HTML5 local storage.

In addition, individual users may opt-out of receiving cookies and HTML5 local storage by setting these values:

* `_pbjs_id_optout` cookie or HTML5 local storage
* `_pubcid_optout` cookie or HTML5 local storage (for backwards compatibility with the original PubCommonID module.

## Basic Configuration

By including this module and one or more of the sub-modules, a number of new options become available in `setConfig()`,
all of them under the `userSync` object as attributes of the `userIds` array
of sub-objects. The table below has the options that are common across ID systems. See the sections below for specific configuration needed by each system and examples.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param under userSync.userIds[] | Scope | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | Required | String | May be: `"britepoolId"`, `"criteo"`, `"fabrickId"`, `"haloId"`, `"id5id"`, `identityLink`, `"idx"`, `"intentIqId"`, `"liveIntentId"`, `"lotamePanoramaId"`, `"merkleId"`, `"netId"`, `"parrableId"`, `"quantcastId"`, `"pubCommonId"`, `"pubProvidedId"`, `"sharedId"`, `"tapadId"`, `"unifiedId"`, `"verizonMediaId"`, `"zeotapIdPlus"` | `"unifiedId"` |
| params | Based on User ID sub-module | Object | | |
| bidders | Optional | Array of Strings | An array of bidder codes to which this user ID may be sent. | `['bidderA', 'bidderB']` |
| storage | Optional | Object | The publisher can specify some kind of local storage in which to store the results of the call to get the user ID. This can be either cookie or HTML5 storage. This is not needed when `value` is specified or the ID system is managing its own storage | |
| storage.type | Required | String | Must be either `"cookie"` or `"html5"`. This is where the results of the user ID will be stored. | `"cookie"` |
| storage.name | Required | String | The name of the cookie or html5 local storage where the user ID will be stored. | `"_unifiedId"` |
| storage.expires | Strongly Recommended | Integer | How long (in days) the user ID information will be stored. If this parameter isn't specified, session cookies are used in cookie-mode, and local storage mode will create new IDs on every page. | `365` |
| storage.refreshInSeconds | Optional | Integer | The amount of time (in seconds) the user ID should be cached in storage before calling the provider again to retrieve a potentially updated value for their user ID. If set, this value should equate to a time period less than the number of days defined in `storage.expires`. By default the ID will not be refreshed until it expires.
| value | Optional | Object | Used only if the page has a separate mechanism for storing a User ID. The value is an object containing the values to be sent to the adapters. | `{"tdid": "1111", "pubcid": {2222}, "IDP": "IDP-2233", "id5id": {"uid": "ID5-12345"}}` |


## User ID Sub-Modules

## Permissions
Publishers can control which user ids are shared with the bid adapters they choose to work with by using the bidders array.  The bidders array is part of the User id module config, publisher may choose to send an id to some bidders but not all, the default behavior is that each user id go to all bid adapters the publisher is working with. 

Use the optional `bidders` parameter to define an array of bidder codes to which this user ID may be sent.

In this example the SharedId sub adapter is only allowed to be sent to the Rubicon adapter.
```
userIds: [
  {
    name: "sharedId",
    bidders: [
      'rubicon'
    ],
    params: {
      syncTime: 60,      // in seconds
      defaultis24hours
    },
    storage: {
      type: "cookie",
      name: "sharedid",
      expires: 28        // in days
    }
  }
]
```
The Rubicon bid adapter would then receive 
```
{
  "bidder": "rubicon",
  ...
  "userId": {
    "sharedid": {
      "id": "01*******",
      "third": "01E*******"
    }
  },
  "userIdAsEids": [
    {
      "source": "sharedid.org",
      "uids": [
        {
          "id": "01**********",
          "atype": 1,
          "ext": {
            "third": "01***********"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

   });
{% endhighlight %}

### Criteo ID for Exchanges

Criteo is the leading advertising platform for the Open Internet. The Criteo ID for Exchanges module enables publishers to access Criteo’s unique demand - more than 20.000 advertisers & brands -  to monetize their exchange inventory with an optimal take rate across all browsing environments.
Note that direct access to that demand is also available through [Criteo Direct Bidder](https://www.criteo.com/products/criteo-direct-bidder/), in which case this module is unnecessary.

The Criteo privacy policy is at [https://www.criteo.com/privacy/](https://www.criteo.com/privacy/).

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=criteoIdSystem

#### Criteo ID Configuration

The Criteo ID module does not require any configuration parameters. It should work as-is provided that bidders use it in their adapters.
When calling Criteo RTB, partners should forward this id in the field `user.ext.prebid_criteoid`.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
NOTE: For optimal performance, the Criteo Id module should be called at every opportunity. It embeds its own optimal caching mechanism. It's best not to use `params.storage` with this module as it may only lower the performances. If you are using multiple id systems, however, you may use it for the other id systems that supports it.

#### Criteo ID Example

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "criteo",
        }]
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

### ID5 Universal ID

The ID5 Universal ID is a shared, neutral identifier that publishers and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users even in environments where 3rd party cookies are not available. The ID5 Universal ID is designed to respect users' privacy choices and publishers’ preferences throughout the advertising value chain. For more information about the ID5 Universal ID and detailed integration docs, please visit [our documentation](https://wiki.id5.io/x/BIAZ). We also recommend that you sign up for our [release notes](https://id5.io/universal-id/release-notes) to stay up-to-date with any changes to the implementation of the ID5 Universal ID in Prebid.

#### ID5 Universal ID Registration

The ID5 Universal ID is free to use, but requires a simple registration with ID5. Please visit [id5.io/universal-id](https://id5.io/universal-id) to sign up and request your ID5 Partner Number to get started.

The ID5 privacy policy is at [https://www.id5.io/platform-privacy-policy](https://www.id5.io/platform-privacy-policy).

#### ID5 Universal ID Configuration

First, make sure to add the ID5 submodule to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=id5IdSystem,userId

The following configuration parameters are available:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param under userSync.userIds[] | Scope | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | Required | String | The name of this module: `"id5Id"` | `"id5Id"` |
| params | Required | Object | Details for the ID5 Universal ID. | |
| params.partner | Required | Number | This is the ID5 Partner Number obtained from registering with ID5. | `173` |
| params.pd | Optional | String | Publisher-supplied data used for linking ID5 IDs across domains. See [our documentation](https://wiki.id5.io/x/BIAZ) for details on generating the string. Omit the parameter or leave as an empty string if no data to supply | `"MT1iNTBjY..."` |
| params.abTesting | Optional | Object | Allows publishers to easily run an A/B Test. If enabled and the user is in the Control Group, the ID5 ID will NOT be exposed to bid adapters for that request | Disabled by default |
| params.abTesting.enabled | Optional | Boolean | Set this to `true` to turn on this feature | `true` or `false` |
| params.abTesting.controlGroupPct | Optional | Number | Must be a number between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive) and is used to determine the percentage of requests that fall into the control group (and thus not exposing the ID5 ID). For example, a value of `0.20` will result in 20% of requests without an ID5 ID and 80% with an ID. | `0.1` |

{: .alert.alert-info :}
**NOTE:** The ID5 Universal ID that is delivered to Prebid will be encrypted by ID5 with a rotating key to avoid unauthorized usage and to enforce privacy requirements. Therefore, we strongly recommend setting `storage.refreshInSeconds` to `8` hours (`8*3600` seconds) to ensure all demand partners receive an ID that has been encrypted with the latest key, has up-to-date privacy signals, and allows them to transact against it.

##### A Note on A/B Testing

Publishers may want to test the value of the ID5 ID with their downstream partners. While there are various ways to do this, A/B testing is a standard approach. Instead of publishers manually enabling or disabling the ID5 User ID Module based on their control group settings (which leads to fewer calls to ID5, reducing our ability to recognize the user), we have baked this in to our module directly.

To turn on A/B Testing, simply edit the configuration (see above table) to enable it and set what percentage of users you would like to set for the control group. The control group is the set of user where an ID5 ID will not be exposed in to bid adapters or in the various user id functions available on the `pbjs` global. An additional value of `ext.abTestingControlGroup` will be set to `true` or `false` that can be used to inform reporting systems that the user was in the control group or not. It's important to note that the control group is user based, and not request based. In other words, from one page view to another, a user will always be in or out of the control group.

#### ID5 Universal ID Examples

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
**ATTENTION:** As of Prebid.js v4.14.0, ID5 requires `storage.type` to be `"html5"` and `storage.name` to be `"id5id"`. Using other values will display a warning today, but in an upcoming release, it will prevent the ID5 module from loading. This change is to ensure the ID5 module in Prebid.js interoperates properly with the [ID5 API](https://github.com/id5io/id5-api.js) and to reduce the size of publishers' first-party cookies that are sent to their web servers. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [prebid@id5.io](mailto:prebid@id5.io).

Publisher wants to retrieve the ID5 Universal ID through Prebid.js

        pd: 'MT1iNTBjY...',      // optional, see table below for a link to how to generate this
        abTesting: {             // optional
          enabled: true,         // false by default
          controlGroupPct: 0.1   // valid values are 0.0 - 1.0 (inclusive)
        }
      },

        expires: 90,             // storage lasts for 90 days
        refreshInSeconds: 8*3600 // refresh ID every 8 hours to ensure it's fresh
      }
    }],
    auctionDelay: 50             // 50ms maximum auction delay, applies to all userId modules
  }
});

### LiveIntent ID

LiveIntent offers audience resolution by leveraging our next-generation identity solutions. The LiveIntent identity graph is built around a people-based set of data that is authenticated daily through active engagements with email newsletters and media across the web. The LiveIntent ID is a user identifier tied to an active, encrypted email in our graph and functions in cookie-challenged environments and browsers.

There are two ways to build your Prebid.js package to include the LiveIntent ID:
* the standard version which allows publishers to include the module with full functionalities, like hashing email adresses and id resolution
* the minimal version, which allows publishers to deploy a smaller bundle with minimal features, including identity resolution.

Add the **full** LiveIntent ID to your Prebid.js package with:
{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=userId,liveIntentIdSystem

Add the **minimal** LiveIntent ID to your Prebid.js package with:
{: .alert.alert-info :}
LiveConnectMode=minimal gulp build --modules=liveIntentIdSystem

The `request.userId.lipb` object would look like:
```
{
  "lipbid": "T7JiRRvsRAmh88",
  "segments": ["999"]
}
```

The adapters can be implemented to use the lipibid as the identifier and segments to which that identifier is associated with. To enable identity resolution for a specific publisher, LiveIntent builds a model on the backend with data collected via an additional call issued on each page load.

#### LiveIntent ID Registration

Please register with us if you’re not a LiveIntent customer already: [https://www.liveintent.com/prebid-registration/](https://www.liveintent.com/prebid-registration/)

When adding LiveIntent’s ID to your Prebid.js package, you disclose or make available Personal Information to LiveIntent.  This information made available to LiveIntent is used to (i) connect with and reference data that already exists in LiveIntent’s graph (the “LiveIntent Graph”), and (ii) authenticate and validate data in aggregate to improve the performance of the services LiveIntent provides. By activating LiveIntent’s module, you hereby confirm that with regard to all individuals to whom Personal Information relates, you have, at or before the point of collecting Personal Information or making Personal Information available to LiveIntent, provided any legally required notices, obtained any legally required consents, and provided individuals with an opportunity to opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information, if such an opt-out is required under applicable laws, such that LiveIntent can provide service to you as described here and in LiveIntent’s privacy policies for the services which can be found at [https://www.liveintent.com/services-privacy-policy/](https://www.liveintent.com/services-privacy-policy/)

#### How does LiveIntent ID work

The LiveIntent ID sub-module resolves the identity of audiences by connecting impression opportunities to a stable identifier (nonID). In order to provide resolution one or more first-party cookies are used to create a stable identifier.

How does LiveIntent ID sub-module decide, which first-party cookies to use:
1. By default LiveIntent ID sub-module generates its own first-party identifier on the publisher’s domain. Publishers have the option to disable the cookie generation when configuring the LiveIntent ID sub-module.
2. A publisher can also define in the configuration which additional first-party cookies should be used. These can be used in a combination with the LiveIntent first-party cookie.

The LiveIntent ID sub-module sends the defined identifiers to the identity graph, which processes them and creates a stable identifier (nonID). The detailed description of the parameters being sent is described here: [Collector parameters](https://github.com/liveintent-berlin/live-connect/blob/HEAD/COLLECTOR_PARAMS.md)

For the identity resolution the LiveIntent ID sub-module makes a request to the LiveIntent’s identity resolution API, which returns a stable identifier and the audience segment(s) a user belongs to. The identifier and the segment are then exposed by the Prebid User ID Module to Prebid adapters to be sent out in a bid request. An SSP can then make the impression opportunity available to any buyers targeting the segment via a deal.

The first-party cookie generation and identity resolution functionality is provided by the LiveConnect JS library, included within the LiveIntent ID sub-module. LiveIntent has created a shared library that is open source, available at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-connect-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-connect-js)

The LiveIntent ID sub-module follows the standard Prebid.js initialization based on the GDPR consumer opt-out choices. With regard to CCPA, the LiveConnect JS receives a us_privacy string from the Prebid US Privacy Consent Management Module and respects opt-outs.

            }
        }]
    }
})
```

2. If you are passing additional identifiers that you want to resolve to the LiveIntent ID, add those under the `identifiersToResolve` array in the configuration parameters.
```
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "liveIntentId",
            params: {

        userIds: [{
            name: "liveIntentId",
            params: {
              publisherId: "9896876",
              identifiersToResolve: ["my-own-cookie"],
              url: "https://publisher.liveintent.com/idex",
              partner: "prebid",
              ajaxTimeout: 1000,

### netID

The [European netID Foundation (EnID)](https://developerzone.netid.de/index.html) aims to establish with the netID an independent European alternative in the digital market for Demand and Supply side. With the netID Single-Sign-On, the EnID established an open standard for consumer logins for services of Buyers and Brands, that also includes user-centric consent management capabilities that results in a standardized, EU-GDPR compliant, IAB TCF aware, cross-device enabled Advertising Identifier, which can be leveraged by publishers and advertisers (and vendors supporting them) to efficiently deliver targeted advertising through programmatic systems to already more than 38 million Europeans on mobile and desktop devices.

The EnID is a non-profit organization which is open to any contributing party on both, the demand and supply side to make identity work for consumers as well as the advertising ecosystem.

#### netID Examples

1) Publisher stores netID via his own logic

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "netId",
            value: {
               "netId":"fH5A3n2O8_CZZyPoJVD-eabc6ECb7jhxCicsds7qSg"
            }
        }]
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Parrable ID

The Parrable ID is a Full Device Identifier that can be used to identify a device across different browsers and webviews on a single device including browsers that have third party cookie restrictions.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=parrableIdSystem

#### Parrable ID Registration

Please contact Parrable to obtain a Parrable Partner Client ID and/or use the Parrable Partner Client ID provided by the vendor for each Parrable-aware bid adapter you will be using.  Note that if you are working with multiple Parrable-aware bid adapters you may use multiple Parrable Partner Client IDs.

The Parrable privacy policy as at [https://www.parrable.com/privacy-policy/](https://www.parrable.com/privacy-policy/).

#### Parrable ID Configuration

In addition to the parameters documented above in the Basic Configuration section the following Parrable specific configuration is required:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param under userSync.userIds[] | Scope | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| params | Required | Object | Details for the Parrable ID. | |
| params.partners | Required | Array[String] | A list of one or more Parrable Partner Client IDs for the Parrable-aware bid adapters you are using.  Please obtain Parrable Partner Client IDs from them and/or obtain your own. | `[ '30182847-e426-4ff9-b2b5-9ca1324ea09b' ]` |
| params.timezoneFilter | Optional | Object | Configures a timezone or timezone offset filter | |
| params.timezoneFilter.allowedZones | Optional | Array[String] | description | `[ 'America/Anchorage' ]` |
| params.timezoneFilter.allowedOffsets | Optional | Array[Number] | description | `[ -4 ]` |
| params.timezoneFilter.blockedZones | Optional | Array[String] | description | `[ 'America/New_York' ]` |
| params.timezoneFilter.blockedOffsets | Optional | Array[Number] | description | `[ -5 ]` |


{: .alert.alert-info :}
NOTE: The Parrable ID that is delivered to Prebid is encrypted by Parrable with a time-based key and updated frequently in the browser to enforce consumer privacy requirements and thus will be different on every page view, even for the same user.

The Parrable ID system manages a cookie with the name of `_parrable_id` containing the ID and optout states of the user.
This cookie is used also by standalone Parrable integrations outside of Prebid.
It is for this reason that the cookie name is not configurable for the Parrable ID system.

#### Timezone and Timezone Offset Filtering

The Parrable ID system enables a publisher to configure lists of **allowed** timezones (eg. `Europe/Dublin`) and/or timezone offsets (eg. `-4`) as well as a lists of **blocked** timezones and timezone offsets.

- With no configuration (`params.timezoneFilter` not set, or all of the lists are empty) all impressions are permitted.
- With only allow lists configured a browser must match either a timezone or timezone offset for it to not be filtered.
- With only block lists configured an impression will be filtered only if it is from a browser matching a blocked timezone or timezone offset.
- An impression from a browser that matches any allowed timezone or timezone offset, but does not match a blocked timezone or timezone offset will engage in the Parrable ID syncronization process.
- If a browser has a stored Parrable ID then it will not be filtered even if the browser is in a timezone or timezone offset that is blocked.

All configured timezones should follow the `TZ database name` column from the [IANA tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

#### Parrable ID Examples

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: `'parrableId'`,
            params: {
              partners: [
                '30182847-e426-4ff9-b2b5-9ca1324ea09b',
                'b07cf20d-8b55-4cd7-9e84-d804ed66b644'
              ], // change to the Parrable Partner Client ID(s) you received from the Parrable Partners you are using
              timezoneFilter: {
                  allowedZones: ['America/New_York', 'Europe/Madrid']
              }
            }
        }],
        syncDelay: 1000
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

### PubCommon ID

This module stores an unique user id in the first party domain and makes it accessible to all adapters. Similar to IDFA and AAID, this is a simple UUID that can be utilized to improve user matching, especially for iOS and MacOS browsers, and is compatible with ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention). It’s lightweight and self contained. Adapters that support Publisher Common ID will be able to pick up the user ID and return it for additional server-side cross device tracking.

There is no special registration or configuration for PubCommon ID. Each publisher's privacy policy should take
PubCommon ID into account.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=pubCommonIdSystem

#### PubCommon ID Configuration

In addition to the parameters documented above in the Basic Configuration section the following PubCommon specific configuration is available:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param under userSync.userIds[] | Scope | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | Required | String | The name of this module. | `'pubCommonId'` |
| params | Optional | Object | Customized parameters | |
| params.create | Optional | Boolean | For publisher server support only.  If true, the publisher's server will create the PubCommon ID cookie.  Default is true. | `true` |
| params.pixelUrl | Optional | String | For publisher server support only.  This is a URL of a pixel for updating cookies' expiration times.  Fired after a new ID has been created or an existing ID is being extended.  No default. | `'https://example.com/ping'`
| params.extend | Optional | Boolean | If true, the expiration time of the stored IDs will be refreshed during each page load.  Default is false. | `false` |
| params.enableSharedId | Optional | Boolean | Invokes [SharedID](/dev-docs/modules/userId.html#shared-id-user-id-submodule) as well as setting PubCommon ID. Defaults to `false` in Prebid.js 4.x. Will default to `true` in Prebid.js 5.0. | `true` |


#### PubCommon ID Examples

1) Publisher supports PubCommonID and first party domain cookie storage

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "pubCommonId",

                type: "cookie",
                name: "_pubcid",         // create a cookie with this name
                expires: 365             // expires in 1 years
            }
        }]
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

2) Publisher supports both UnifiedID and PubCommonID and first party domain cookie storage

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {

            name: "unifiedId",
            params: {
                partner: "myTtdPid"
            },
            storage: {
                type: "cookie",
                name: "pbjs-unifiedid",       // create a cookie with this name
                expires: 60
            }
        },{
            name: "pubCommonId",
            params: {

{: .alert.alert-info :}
When enableSharedId is true, the browser will make an additional call to id.sharedid.org/usync.  Calling to Shareid.org sets a user id in a 3rd party cookie under the sharedid.org domain. Anyone setting this additional identity should reference Sharedid.orgs optout policy at https://sharedid.org/. Prebid.js 5.0 will enable the enableSharedId option by default.


### PubProvided ID

The PubProvided Id module allows publishers to set and pass a first party user id into the bid stream. This module has several unique characteristics:

1. The module supports a user defined function, that generates an eids-style object:

```
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "pubProvidedId",
            params: {
                eidsFunction: getIdsFn   // any function that exists in the page
            }
        }]
    }
});
```

Or, the eids values can be passed directly into the `setConfig` call:
```
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "example.com",
            params: {
                eids: [{
                    source: "domain.com",
                    uids:[{
                      id: "value read from cookie or local storage",
                      atype: 1,
                      ext: {
                          stype: "ppuid"
                      }

                  }]
                },{
                    source: "3rdpartyprovided.com",
                    uids:[{
                      id: "value read from cookie or local storage",
                      atype: 3,
                      ext: {
                          stype: "dmp"
                      }
                  }]
                }]
            }
        }]
    }
});
```

In either case, bid adapters will receive the eid values after consent is validated.

2. This design allows for the setting of any number of uuids in the eids object. Publishers may work with multiple ID providers and nest their own id within the same eids object.  The opportunity to link a 1st party uuid and a 3rd party generated UUID presents publishers with a unique ability to address their users in a way demand sources will understand.

3. Finally, this module allows publishers to broadcast their user id, derived from in-house tech, directly to buyers within the confines of existing compliance (CCPA & GDPR) frameworks.

4. The `eids.uids.ext.stype` "source-type" extension helps downstream entities know what do with the data. Currently defined values are:

- dmp - this uid comes from the in-page dmp named in eids.source
- ppuid - this uid comes from the publisher named in eids.source
- other - TBD

5. Bid adapters listening for "userIds.pubProvidedId" will not receive a string, please use the userIdAsEids value/function to return the userid as a string.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=pubProvidedId


#### PubProvided Configuration

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }

### Quantcast ID

Quantcast ID enables publishers that use Quantcast Measure tag to uniquely identify
their clients within Quantcast's extensive publisher network without relying on third party
cookies. The Quantcast User ID submodule makes the existing Quantcast first party
cookie available in the bid request. The first party cookie allows Quantcast to correlate
the bid request with Quantcast's Measure dataset.

Currently, Quantcast ID only works with the presence of Quantcast Measure tag. More information
about Measure can be found in https://www.quantcast.com/measure.

The Quantcast privacy policy is at https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

### Unified ID

The Unified ID solution is provided by adsrvr.org and the Trade Desk.

Add it to your Prebid.js package with:

{: .alert.alert-info :}
gulp build --modules=unifiedIdSystem

#### Unified ID Registration

You can set up Unified ID in one of these ways:

- Register with The Trade Desk from their [Unified ID page](https://www.thetradedesk.com/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution).
- Utilize a [managed services](https://prebid.org/product-suite/managed-services/) company who can do this for you.

The Unified ID privacy is covered under the [TradeDesk Services Privacy Policy](https://www.thetradedesk.com/general/privacy).

#### Unified ID Configuration

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param under userSync.userIds[] | Scope | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | Required | String | `"unifiedId"` | `"unifiedId"` |
| params | Required for UnifiedId | Object | Details for UnifiedId initialization. | |
| params.partner | Either this or url required for UnifiedId | String | This is the partner ID value obtained from registering with The Trade Desk or working with a Prebid.js managed services provider. | `"myTtdPid"` |
| params.url | Required for UnifiedId if not using TradeDesk | String | If specified for UnifiedId, overrides the default Trade Desk URL. | "https://unifiedid.org/somepath?args" |
| value | Optional | Object | Used only if the page has a separate mechanism for storing the Unified ID. The value is an object containing the values to be sent to the adapters. In this scenario, no URL is called and nothing is added to local storage | `{"tdid": "D6885E90-2A7A-4E0F-87CB-7734ED1B99A3"}` |

#### Unified ID Examples

1) Publisher has a partner ID with The Trade Desk, and is using the default endpoint for Unified ID.

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
Bug: The default URL did not support HTTPS in Prebid.js 2.10-2.14. So instead of using
the 'partner' parameter, it's best to supply the Trade Desk URL as shown in this example.

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "unifiedId",
            params: {
                url: "//match.adsrvr.org/track/rid?ttd_pid=MyTtidPid&fmt=json"
            },
            storage: {
                type: "cookie",
                name: "pbjs-unifiedid",       // create a cookie with this name
                expires: 60                   // cookie can last for 60 days
            }
        }],
        syncDelay: 3000              // 3 seconds after the first auction
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

2) Publisher supports UnifiedID with a vendor other than Trade Desk and HTML5 local storage.

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "unifiedId",
            params: {
                url: "URL_TO_UNIFIED_ID_SERVER"
            },
            storage: {
                type: "html5",
                name: "pbjs-unifiedid",    // set localstorage with this name
                expires: 60
            }
        }],
        syncDelay: 3000
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

3) Publisher has integrated with UnifiedID on their own and wants to pass the UnifiedID directly through to Prebid.js.

{% highlight javascript %}
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        userIds: [{
            name: "unifiedId",
            value: {"tdid": "D6885E90-2A7A-4E0F-87CB-7734ED1B99A3"}
        }]
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

## Bidder Adapter Implementation

### Prebid.js Adapters

Bidders that want to support the User ID module in Prebid.js, need to update their bidder adapter to read the indicated bidRequest attributes and pass them to their endpoint.

<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">
| ID System Name | ID System Host | Prebid.js Attr | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BritePool ID | BritePool | bidRequest.userId.britepoolid | `"1111"` |
| CriteoID | Criteo | bidRequest.userId.criteoId | `"1111"` |
| Halo ID | Audigent | bidRequest.userId.haloId | `{"haloId":"user-halo-id", "auSeg":["segment1","segment2"]}` |
| ID+ | Zeotap | bidRequest.userId.IDP | `"1111"` |
| ID5 ID | ID5 | bidRequest.userId.id5id | `{ uid: "1111", ext: { linkType: 2, abTestingControlGroup: false } }` |
| IdentityLink | Trade Desk | bidRequest.userId.idl_env | `"1111"` |
| IntentIQ ID | IntentIQ | bidRequest.userId.intentiqid | `"1111"` |
| LiveIntent ID | Live Intent | bidRequest.userId.lipb.lipbid | `"1111"` |
| Lotame Panorama ID | Lotame | bidRequest.userId.lotamePanoramaId | `"e4b96a3d9a8e8761cef5656fb05f16d53938069f1684df4b2257e276e8b89a0e"` |
| merkleID | Merkle | bidRequest.userId.merkleId | `"1111"` |
| netID | netID | bidRequest.userId.netId | `"fH5A3n2O8_CZZyPoJVD-eabc6ECb7jhxCicsds7qSg"` |
| Parrable ID | Parrable | bidRequest.userId.parrableId | `{"eid":"01.1594654046.cd0972d861e98ff3723a368a6efa69287a0df3f1cac9142afc2e7aed1caa8dd1b7fc0590b3baf67525f53e1228024c2805b6041206c7a23e34bb823b0659547d7d1d0dac2a11938e867f"}` |
| PubCommon ID | n/a | bidRequest.userId.pubcid | `"1111"` |
| PubProvided ID | n/a | bidRequest.userId.pubProvidedId | `"1111"` |
| Quantcast ID | n/a | bidRequest.userId.quantcastId | `"1111"` |
| Tapad ID | Tapad | bidRequest.userId.tapadId | `"1111"` |
| Shared ID | SharedId | bidRequest.userId.sharedid | `{"id":"01EAJWWNEPN3CYMM5N8M5VXY22","third":"01EAJWWNEPN3CYMM5N8M5VXY22"}` |
| Unified ID | Trade Desk | bidRequest.userId.tdid | `"1111"` |
| Verizon Media ConnectID | Verizon Media | bidRequest.userId.connectid | `"72d04af6e07c2eb93e9c584a131f48b6a9b963bcb2736d624e987ff8cf36d472"` |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
</div>

For example, the adapter code might do something like:

{% highlight javascript %}
   if (bidRequest.userId && bidRequest.userId.pubcid) {
    url+="&pubcid="+bidRequest.userId.pubcid;
   }
{% endhighlight %}

### Prebid Server Adapters

Bidders that want to support the User ID module in Prebid Server, need to update their server-side bid adapter to read the desired OpenRTB attributes noted in the example below and send them to their endpoint.

### ID Providers

If you're an ID provider that wants to get on this page:

- Fork Prebid.js and write a sub-module similar to one of the *IdSystem modules already in the [modules](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/tree/master/modules) folder.
- Add your *IdSystem name into the modules/.submodules.json file
- Follow all the guidelines in the [contribution page](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Submit a Pull Request against the [Prebid.js repository](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js).
- Fork the prebid.org [documentation repository](https://github.com/prebid/prebid.github.io), modify the /dev-docs/modules/userId.md, and submit a documentation Pull Request as well.

<a name="getUserIds"></a>

### Exporting User IDs

If you need to export the user IDs stored by Prebid User ID module, the `getUserIds()` function will return an object formatted the same as bidRequest.userId.

```
pbjs.getUserIds() // returns object like bidRequest.userId. e.g. {"pubcid":"1111", "tdid":"2222"}
```

You can use [`getUserIdsAsEids()`](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/publisher-api-reference.html#userId.getUserIdsAsEids) to get the user IDs stored by Prebid User ID module in ORTB Eids format. Refer [eids.md](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/modules/userId/eids.md) for output format.
```
pbjs.getUserIdsAsEids() // returns userIds in ORTB Eids format. e.g.
[
  {
      source: 'pubcid.org',
      uids: [{
          id: 'some-random-id-value',
          atype: 1
      }]
  },

  {
      source: 'adserver.org',
      uids: [{
          id: 'some-random-id-value',
          atype: 1,
          ext: {
              rtiPartner: 'TDID'
          }
      }]
  },

  {
      source: 'id5-sync.com',
      uids: [{
          id: 'ID5-12345',
          atype: 1,
          ext: {
              linkType: 2,
              abTestingControlGroup: false
          }
      }]
  }
]
```

## Passing UserIds to Google Ad Manager for targeting

User IDs from Prebid User ID module can be passed to GAM for targeting in Google Ad Manager or to pass ahead in Google Exchange Bidding using ```userIdTargeting``` module. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/modules/userIdTargeting.md). In short, you just need to add the optional userIdTargeting sub-module into your `gulp build` command and the additional `userIdTargeting` config becomes available.
