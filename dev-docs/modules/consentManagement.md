# GDPR Consent Management Module
{: .no_toc }

* TOC
{: toc }

## Overview

This consent management module is designed to support the EU General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://www.iab.com/topics/consumer-privacy/gdpr/))

This module works with supported [Consent Management Platforms](https://advertisingconsent.eu/cmp-list/) (CMPs) to fetch an encoded string representing the user's consent choices and make it available for adapters to consume and process.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
See also the [Prebid Consent Management - US Privacy Module](/dev-docs/modules/consentManagementUsp.html) for supporting the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
Prebid functionality created to address regulatory requirements does not replace each party's responsibility to determine its own legal obligations and comply with all applicable laws.
**We recommend consulting with your legal counsel before determining how to utilize these features in support of your overall privacy approach.**

Here's a summary of the interaction process:

1. Fetch the user's GDPR consent data from the CMP.
2. Incorporate this data into the auction objects for adapters to collect.
3. Proceed with the auction.

In the case of a new user, CMPs will generally respond only after there is consent information available (i.e., the user has made their consent choices).
Making these selections can take some time for the average user, so the module provides timeout settings.

If the timeout period expires or an error from the CMP is thrown, one of these actions occurs:

- The auction is canceled outright.
- The auction proceeds without the user's consent information.  

## Page Integration

To utilize this module, a CMP compatible with the [IAB 1.1 TCF spec](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-v1/) needs to be implemented on the site to interact with the user and obtain their consent choices.  

Though implementation details for the CMP are not covered by Prebid.org, we do recommend to that you place the CMP code before the Prebid.js code in the head of the page in order to ensure the CMP's framework is loaded before the Prebid code executes.

Once the CMP is implemented, simply include this module into your build and add a `consentManagement` object in the `setConfig()` call.  Adapters that support this feature will then be able to retrieve the consent information and incorporate it in their requests.

Here are the parameters supported in the `consentManagement` object:

{: .alert.alert-warning :}
Note that versions of Prebid.js before 2.43.0 had a different GDPR configuration. The module is backwards-compatible,
but we recommend migrating to the new config structure as soon as possible.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Param | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gdpr | `Object` | | |
| gdpr.cmpApi | `string` | The CMP interface that is in use. Supported values are **'iab'** or **'static'**. Static allows integrations where IAB-formatted consent strings are provided in a non-standard way. Default is `'iab'`. | `'iab'` |
| gdpr.timeout | `integer` | Length of time (in milliseconds) to allow the CMP to obtain the GDPR consent string. Default is `10000`. | `10000` |
| gdpr.allowAuctionWithoutConsent | `boolean` | Determines what will happen if obtaining consent information from the CMP fails; either allow the auction to proceed (`true`) or cancel the auction (`false`). Default is `true` | `true` |
| gdpr.consentData | `Object` | An object representing the GDPR consent data being passed directly; only used when cmpApi is 'static'. Default is `undefined`. Not currently supported for US Privacy. | |

{: .alert.alert-info :}
NOTE: The `allowAuctionWithoutConsent` parameter refers to the entire consent string, not to any individual consent option. Prebid.js does not parse the GDPR consent string, so it doesn't know if the user has consented to any particular action.

### Examples

Example 1: GDPR IAB CMP using custom timeout and cancel-auction options.

{% highlight js %}
     var pbjs = pbjs || {};
     pbjs.que = pbjs.que || [];
     pbjs.que.push(function() {
        pbjs.setConfig({
          consentManagement: {
            gdpr: {
              cmpApi: 'iab',
              timeout: 8000,
              allowAuctionWithoutConsent: false
            }
          }
        });
        pbjs.addAdUnits(adUnits);
     });
{% endhighlight %}

Example 2: Static CMP using custom data passing.

{% highlight js %}
     var pbjs = pbjs || {};
     pbjs.que = pbjs.que || [];
     pbjs.que.push(function() {
        pbjs.setConfig({
          consentManagement: {
            gdpr: {
              cmpApi: 'static',
              allowAuctionWithoutConsent: false,
              consentData: {
                getConsentData: {
                  'gdprApplies': true,
                  'hasGlobalScope': false,
                  'consentData': 'BOOgjO9OOgjO9APABAENAi-AAAAWd7_______9____7_9uz_Gv_r_ff_3nW0739P1A_r_Oz_rm_-zzV44_lpQQRCEA'
                },
                getVendorConsents: {
                  'metadata': 'BOOgjO9OOgjO9APABAENAi-AAAAWd7_______9____7_9uz_Gv_r_ff_3nW0739P1A_r_Oz_rm_-zzV44_lpQQRCEA',
                ...
                }
              }
            }
          }
        });
        pbjs.addAdUnits(adUnits);
     });
{% endhighlight %}

## Build the Package

Follow the basic build instructions in the GitHub Prebid.js repo's main [README](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/README.md). To include the consent management module, an additional option must be added to the **gulp build** command:

{% highlight bash %}
gulp build --modules=consentManagement,bidAdapter1,bidAdapter2
{% endhighlight %}

## Adapter Integration

If you are submitting changes to an adapter to support this approach, please also submit a PR to the [docs repo](https://github.com/prebid/prebid.github.io) to add the `gdpr_supported: true` variable to your respective page in the [bidders directory](https://github.com/prebid/prebid.github.io/tree/master/dev-docs/bidders).  **This will ensure that your adapter's name will automatically appear on the list of adapters supporting GDPR.**

### Bidder Adapter GDPR Integration

To find the GDPR consent information to pass along to your system, adapters should look for the `bidderRequest.gdprConsent` field in their `buildRequests()` method.
Here is a sample of how the data is structured in the `bidderRequest` object:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "bidderCode": "bidderA",
  "auctionId": "e3a336ad-2222-4a1c-bbbb-ecc7c5294a34",
  ...
  "timeout": 3000,
  "gdprConsent": {
    "consentString": "BOJ/P2HOJ/P2HABABMAAAAAZ+A==",
    "vendorData": {...},
    "gdprApplies": true
  },
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

**gdprConsent Data Fields**

**_consentString_**

This field contains the user's choices on consent, represented as an encoded string value.  In certain scenarios, this field might come to you with an `undefined` value; normally this happens when there was an error during the CMP interaction and the publisher had the config option `allowAuctionWithoutConsent` set to `true`.  If you don't want to pass `undefined` to your system, you can check for this value and replace it with a valid consent string.  See the *consent_required* code in the example below (under "gdprApplies") for a possible approach to checking and replacing values.

**_vendorData_**

This field contains the raw vendor data in relation to the user's choices on consent.  This object will hold a map of all available vendors for any potential adapters that want to read the data directly.  One use-case for reading from this field would be when an adapter wants to be omitted from a request where they were not given consent.  Adapters are able to read through the object to find their appropriate information.

**_gdprApplies_**

This boolean field represents whether the user in question is in an area where GDPR applies.  This field comes from the CMP itself; it's included in the response when a request is made to the CMP API.  On the rare occasion where this value isn't defined by the CMP, each adapter has the opportunity to set their own value for this field.

One of two general approaches can be taken by the adapter to populate this field:

- Set a hardcoded default value.
- Use their own system to determine whether consent is required for the end-user and set the value accordingly.

The folowing is an example of how the integration could look for the former option:

{% highlight js %}
...
buildRequests: function (bidRequests, bidderRequest) {
  ...
  if (bidderRequest && bidderRequest.gdprConsent) {
    adapterRequest.gdpr_consent = {
      consent_string: bidderRequest.gdprConsent.consentString,
      // will check if the gdprApplies field was populated with a boolean value (ie from page config).  If it's undefined, then default to true
      consent_required: (typeof bidderRequest.gdprConsent.gdprApplies === 'boolean') ? bidderRequest.gdprConsent.gdprApplies : true
    }
  }
  ...
}
...
{% endhighlight %}

The implementation of the latter option is up to the adapter, but the general premise is the same.  You would check to see if the `bidderRequest.gdprConsent.gdprApplies` field is undefined and if so, set the derived value from your independent system.

If neither option are taken, then there is the remote chance this field's value will be undefined.  As long as that's acceptable for the given system, this could be a potential third option.

### UserSync Integration

The `gdprConsent` object is also available when registering `userSync` pixels.
The object can be accessed by including it as an argument in the `getUserSyncs` function:

{% highlight js %}
getUserSyncs: function(syncOptions, responses, gdprConsent, usPrivacy) {
...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Depending on your needs, you could include the consent information in a query of your pixel and/or, given the consent choices, determine if you should drop the pixels at all.

## Publishers not using an IAB-Compliant CMP

Prebid.js and much of the ad industry rely on the IAB CMP standard for GDPR support, but there might be some publishers who have implemented a different approach to meeting the privacy rules. Those publishers can utilize Prebid.js and the whole header bidding ecosystem by building a translation layer between their consent method and the IAB method.

At a high level, this could be done as follows:  
1. Build a `window.__cmp()` function, which will be seen by Prebid.
2. If SafeFrames are in use, build a message receiver function.
3. Format consent data in a string according to the [IAB standard](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework).

Below is sample code for implementing the stub functions. Sample code for formatting the consent string can be obtained [here](https://github.com/appnexus/cmp).

{% highlight js %}
var iabConsentData;  // build the IAB consent string
var gdprApplies;     // true if gdpr applies to the user, else false
var hasGlobalScope;  // true if consent data was retrieved globally
var responseCode;    // false if there was an error, else true
var cmpLoaded;       // true if iabConsentData was loaded and processed
(function(window, document) {
    function addFrame() {
        if (window.frames['__cmpLocator'])
            return;
        if ( document.body ) {
            var body = document.body,
                iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
            iframe.name = '__cmpLocator';
            iframe.style.display = 'none';
            body.appendChild(iframe);
        } else {
            setTimeout(addFrame, 5);
        }
    }
    addFrame();
    function cmpMsgHandler(event) {
        try {
            var json = event.data;
            var msgIsString = typeof json === "string";
            if ( msgIsString ) {
                json = JSON.parse(json);
            }
            var call = json.__cmpCall;
            if (call) {
                window.__cmp(call.command, call.parameter, function(retValue, success) {
                    var returnMsg = {
                        __cmpReturn: {
                            returnValue: retValue, success: success, callId: call.callId
                        }
                    };
                    event.source.postMessage(msgIsString ? JSON.stringify(returnMsg) : returnMsg, '*');
                });
            }
        } catch (e) {}  // do nothing
    }
    var cmpFunc = function(command, version, callback) {
        if (command === 'ping') {
            callback({gdprAppliesGlobally: gdprApplies, cmpLoaded: cmpLoaded}, responseCode);
        } else if (command === 'getConsentData') {
            callback({consentData: iabConsentData, gdprApplies: gdprApplies, hasGlobalScope: hasGlobalScope}, responseCode);
        } else if (command === 'getVendorConsents') {
            callback({metadata: iabConsentData, gdprApplies: gdprApplies, hasGlobalScope: hasGlobalScope}, responseCode);
        } else {
            callback(undefined, false);
        }
    };
    if ( typeof (__cmp) !== 'function' ) {
        window.__cmp = cmpFunc;
        window.__cmp.msgHandler = cmpMsgHandler;
        if ( window.addEventListener ) {
            window.addEventListener('message', cmpMsgHandler, false);
        } else {
            window.attachEvent('onmessage', cmpMsgHandler);
        }
    }
})(window, document);
{% endhighlight %}

### Explanation of Parameters

**_iabConsentData_**  
For instructions on how to generate the IAB consent string see the [IAB CMP 1.1 Spec](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) and [IAB Consent String SDK](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/tree/master/Consent%20String%20SDK).

**_gdprApplies_**  
Use the following values in the _gdprApplies_ field:
- True: the current user is in the European Economic Area (EEA) *or* the publisher wants to have all traffic considered in-scope for GDPR.
- False: It's known that the user is outside the EEA.
- Leave the attribute unspecified if user's location is unknown.

**_hasGlobalScope_**  
This should be set to true if consent data was retrieved from global "euconsent" cookie, or it was publisher-specific. For general purpose, set this to false.

**_responseCode_**  
This should be false if there was some error in the consent data; otherwise set to true. False is the same as calling the callback with no parameters.

**_cmpLoaded_**  
This should be be set to true once the parameters listed above are processed.
