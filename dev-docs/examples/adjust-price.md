#### Line 35 to 42: Adjust Bid Price

Some bidders return gross prices, instead of the net prices (what the publisher will actually get paid). For example, a publisher’s net price might be 15% below the returned gross price. In this case, the publisher may want to adjust the bidder’s returned price to run a true header bidding auction. Otherwise, this bidder’s gross price will unfairly win over your other demand sources who report the real price.

(AppNexus does return the net price. This is just an example for adjusting bid prices.)
