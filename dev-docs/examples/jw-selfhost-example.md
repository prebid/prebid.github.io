about:
- Setting up JW Player to dynamically play ads.
- Using a self-hosted player.
- Dynamically insert a preroll ad into JW Player.
player_notes:
- You must have the correct JW Player license that allows you to play advertising.
- For documentation on the different methods of embedding JW Player on your site, see <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">Embedding With JW Player</a>. 
- For this example we will be using <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed#fndtn-method-3">method 3</a>, a self-hosted player with JW Platform hosted content.
- To see an example using the cloud-hosted player, see <a href="/dev-docs/examples/jw-cloud-example.html">Show a Video Ad in a Cloud Hosted JW Player</a>.
- No matter what embedding method you choose to use, you must follow the <b>custom embed</b> instructions. You cannot use the single-line embed.
