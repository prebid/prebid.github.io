about:
- Including the correct scripts on the page. A guide can be found at <a href="http://help.ooyala.com/video-platform/documentation/concepts/pbv4_plugins.html">Player V4 Plugins</a>.
- Using the Ooyala v4 player API.
- Using Ooyala's Google IMA plugin.
- Passing a VAST tag to the Ooyala player.
player_notes:
- This guide uses the V4 Ooyala player. To get the embed code for the V4 player, select <b>New Ooyala Player (V4) Embed Code</b> in the embed options instead of HTML Embed Code. 
- Do not select an ad set in the 'Monetize' tab. We'll control that setting on the page (see example code below).
