about:
- Using <code>invokeVideoPlayer</code> to set up and access the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/getting-started-brightcove-player">Brightcove Player</a> instance.
- Using the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/player-catalog#getVideo">catalog API</a> to load a media file dynamically.
- Using <code>bc()</code> to make sure all the necessary scripts are loaded before playing an ad.
- Playing an ad using Brightcove's <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/advertising-ima3-plugin">ima3 plugin</a>.
- Configuring the player's ima3 settings on page.
player_notes:
- For this demo we'll be configuring the player's ima3 settings on the page instead of in Video Cloud. Make sure you load the ima3 script and CSS file in addition to your player script.
- On the publish page for the player, choose the <b>Advanced</b> embed code (not <b>Standard</b>).
- If you're playing a preroll ad, do not include the videoID in the video element.
