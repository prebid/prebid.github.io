about:
- Code needed to show outstream video ads using the new media type, <code>video-outstream</code>
- Other than setting up the ad unit, very little change from standard Prebid for engineering
- No changes in ad ops setup; use standard Prebid creatives
- Must have demand from video-enabled bidder adapters
- <em>Note</em> - this example only works sporadically in the embedded JSFiddle below - try <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/prebid/1my9u9ep/7/">running it from JSFiddle.net directly</a>
- For more information, including links to more outstream examples, see <a href="/dev-docs/show-outstream-video-ads.html">Show Outstream Video Ads</a>
