about:
- Code needed to show outstream video ads using the <code>video</code> media type with <code>outstream</code> context
- Other than setting up the ad unit, very little change from standard Prebid for engineering
- No changes in ad ops setup; use standard Prebid creatives
- Must have demand from video-enabled bidder adapters
- <em>Note</em> - this example only works sporadically in the embedded JSFiddle below - try <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/prebid/e9bb94L6/9/">running it from JSFiddle.net directly</a>
- See also the following examples hosted on Prebid.org - <a href="/examples/video/outstream/outstream-dfp-two-adapters-demo.html">Show an outstream ad using Unruly and AppNexus</a>, and <a href="/examples/video/outstream/outstream-no-adserver-demo.html">Show an outstream ad without an ad server</a>
