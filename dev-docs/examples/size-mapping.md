#### Line 13: Add size mapping to the ad unit

You can use the ad unit's new `sizeMapping` property to declaratively specify the ad sizes that should be shown when the device screen is greater than or equal to a given size.

For example, as shown in the first ad unit, if `minWidth` is set to `1024`, then Prebid.js will attempt to show a 300x250 ad (the first size in the array).  If no ad that size is available, it will try to show a 300x600 ad.  Otherwise, it will use the largest ad size in `sizes`.
