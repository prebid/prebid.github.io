# Vendor Billing in Prebid.js
{:.no_toc}

Prebid.js now supports a new event type: **Billable Event**. Billable events allow **Real Time Data (RTD)** modules to signal that their system calculated that a billing event occurred. Billable  events are trackable by analytics adapters as well as publishers to track and aggregate billing data.

## Emitting Events

In order to emit events, **RTD** modules simply need to utilize the existing Events system already integrated into Prebid.js. A new event, **“BILLABLE_EVENT”**, is registered inside the constants.json file for usage.

Currently there are limited requirements about the contents of billable events. However, it should be expected that partners who choose to leverage Billable Events may have unique requirements or implementations that will be documented individually, including adding additional parameters to the events as they see fit.

**Required Parameters**

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| **Parameter**  |  **Type** |  **Definition** |
|----------------+-----------+-----------------|
|  vendor |  string | Contains the unique name of the vendor, and will be used to identify which vendor triggered a given event.  |
|  billingId |  UUID |  A unique UUID associated with a given billing event.  Generated by the vendor. |

A general schema of a **“BILLABLE_EVENT”** is shown below:

```json
{
 "type":"object",
 "required":[
    "vendor",
    "billingId"
 ],
 "properties":{
    "vendor":{
       "type":"string",
       "description":"The name of the vendor who emitted the billable event"
    },
    "billingId":{
       "type":"string",
       "description":"A UUID which is responsible more mapping this event to"
    }
 }
}

```

It is expected that vendors will not emit duplicate events.

## Analytics Adapter Tracking Events
The [AnalyticsAdapter.js](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/BillingEvents/src/AnalyticsAdapter.js#L121 "AnalyticsAdapter.js") interface now allows the tracking of **BILLABLE_EVENTS**. It is assumed that analytics adapters and their downstream reporting handles their own tracking of events as well as contracts between vendors and publishers.
