#### Registration

The ID5 Analytics Adapter is free to use during our Beta period, but requires a simple registration with ID5. Please visit [id5.io/solutions](https://id5.io/solutions#publishers) to sign up and request your ID5 Partner Number to get started. If you're already using the ID5 Universal ID, you may use your existing Partner Number with the analytics adapter.

The ID5 privacy policy is at [https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy](https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy).
