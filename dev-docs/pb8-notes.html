## Transaction identifiers are now reliable and opt in

Following the [OpenRTB 2.6 spec](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb2.x/blob/main/2.6.md) and the [imp.ext.tid] (https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/blob/master/extensions/community_extensions/per-imp-tids.md) community extensions, several fields in Prebid have equivalents in OpenRTB. 

$.id, the top level id, is now unique to each bid request. It may come from a bidder `getUUID` call or from the `bidderRequestId`.
$.imp.ext.tid is the same for each bidder and differs for each slot in the auction. It is the request object `transactionId`. It can be set by the publisher to sync with other header bidding libraries on the page. 
$.source.tid is the same for each bidder and differs for each auction. We understand from buyer platform members that it is losing utility in favor of `imp.ext.tid`. It is the request object `auctionId`. It can be set by the publisher to sync with other header bidding libraries on the page. 
$.source.schain.nodes[0].rid is not generated by the Prebid.js core library nor the schain module and may vary unexpectedly. We don't recommend anyone rely on it as a stand in for the seller on the page's request identifier currently. 

These identifiers are extremely powerful for discrepency reconciliation, ad quality investigations, consent audits, and a huge range of other applications. They also allow data appended to different requests (eg dealIds) to be commingled downstream. For this reason, our publisher committee and Prebid.org counsel have decided to require publisher opt in to their inclusion in the bid stream. This meant Prebid engineering changed every openrtb request in the project to potentially transmit a null in these fields. Todo comments were added to bid adapters not using OpenRTB that send them over the wire to confirm they can accept null values. 


## Activity Controls

TCF1 is no longer supported by the Consent Management (GDPR) module. The Consent Management USP module now defaults to framework 'iab' and will work without configuration if installed and a functioning `__uspapi()` exists on the page.


## Build changes

In later 6.x versions, an improvement in the build process introduced some undesirable behavior for users loading the library twice on the same pageview to the same global library name. If you load Prebid.js twice on a page using the same global, the second load is now prevented.
