As of August 2020, privacy regulations have changed such that new creatives entered
in GAM may require a <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9972771?hl=en">declaration of the ad technology provider</a>. The first step
is to note the domain you serve the creative from. The examples above offer the
use of the jsdelvr.com CDN. However, you may obtain the creative from a managed
service or you may host it yourself. If you receive a warning from ad manager
about "declaring self-created ad technology", you should be able to work around
this by editing the creative and filling out the "Associated Ad Technology Provid
ers" section as shown in this screen capture:
